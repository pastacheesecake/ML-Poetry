Since the world is on a delusional course, we must adopt a
delusional standpoint towards the world.
Better to die from extremes than starting from the extremities.

AFTER THE ORGY

If I were asked to characterize the present state of affairs, I would describe it as
'after the orgy' . The orgy in question was the moment when modernity
exploded upon us, the moment of liberation in every sphere. Political lib­
eration, sexual liberation, liberation of the forces of production, liberation of
the forces of destruction, women's liberation, children's liberation, liberation
of unconscious drives, liberation of art. The assumption of all models of
representation, as of all models of anti-representation. This was a total orgy ­
an orgy of the real, the rational, the sexual, of criticism as of anti-criticism, of
development as of the crisis of development. We have pursued every avenue
in the production and effective overproduction of objects, signs, messages,
ideologies and satisfactions . Now everything has been liberated, the chips are
down, and we find ourselves faced collectively with the big question: WHAT DO
WE DO NOW THE ORGY IS OVER?

Now all we can do is simulate the orgy, simulate liberation. We may
pretend to carry on in the same direction, accelerating, but in reality we are
accelerating in a void, because all the goals of liberation are already behind us,

and because what haunts and obsesses us is being thus ahead of all the results
- the very availability of all the signs, all the forms, all the desires that we had
been pursuing. But what can we do? This is the state of simulation, a state in
which we are obliged to replay all scenarios precisely because they have all
taken place already, whether actually or potentially. The state of utopia
realized, of all utopias realized, wherein paradoxically we must continue to live
as though they had not been. But since they have, and since we can no longer,
therefore, nourish the hope of realizing them, we can only 'hyper-realize' them
through interminable simulation. We live amid the interminable reproduction
of ideals, phantasies, images and dreams which are now behind us, yet which
we must continue to reproduce in a sort of inescapable indifference.
The fact is that the revolution has well and truly happened, but not in the way
we expected. Everywhere what has been liberated has been liberated so that it
can enter a state of pure circulation, so that it can go into orbit. With the benefit
of a little hindsight, we may say that the unavoidable goal of all liberation is to
foster and provision circulatory networks. The fate of the things liberated is an
incessant commutation, and these things are thus subject to increasing inde­
terminacy, to the principle of uncertainty.
Nothing (not even God) now disappears by coming to an end, by dying.
Instead, things disappear through proliferation or contamination, by becoming
saturated or transparent, because of extenuation or extermination, or as a
result of the epidemic of simulation, as a result of their transfer into the
secondary existence of simulation. Rather than a mortal mode of disappear­
ance, then, a fractal mode of dispersal.
Nothing is truly reflected any more - whether in a mirror or in the abyssal
realm (which is merely the endless reduplication of consciousness). The logic
of viral dispersal in networks is no longer a logic of value; neither, therefore,.is
it a logic of equivalence. There is no longer any such thing as a revolution"of

values - merely a circumvention or involution of values. A centripetal compul­
sion coexists with a decentredness of all systems, an internal metastasis or
fevered endogenic virulence which creates a tendency for systems to explode
beyond their own limits, to override their own logic - not in the sense of
creating sheer redundancy, but in the sense of an increase in power, a fantastic
potentialization whereby their own very existence is put at risk.
All of which brings us back to the fate of value. Once, out of some obscure need
to classify, I proposed a tripartite account of value: a natural stage (use-value),
a commodity stage (exchange-value), and a structural stage (sign-value) . Value
thus had a natural aspect, a commodity aspect, and a structural aspect. These
distinctions are formal ones, of course - reminiscent of the distinctions
between the particles physicists are always coming up with. A new particle
does not replace those discovered earlier: it simply joins their ranks, takes its
place in a hypothetical series. So let me introduce a new particle into the
microphysics of simulacra. For after the natural, commodity, and structural
stages of value comes the fractal stage. The first of these stages had a natural
referent, and value developed on the basis of a natural use of the world. The
second was founded on a general equivalence, and value developed by
reference to a logic of the commodity. The third is governed by a code, and
value develops here by reference to a set of models. At the fourth, the fractal (or
viral, or radiant) stage of value, there is no point of reference at all, and value
radiates in all directions, occupying all interstices, without reference to any­
thing whatsoever, by virtue of pure contiguity. At the fractal stage there is no
longer any equivalence, whether natural or general. Properly speaking there is
now no law of value, merely a sort of epidemic of value, a sort of general
metastasis of value, a haphazard proliferation and dispersal of value. Indeed,
we should really no longer speak of 'value' at all, for this kind of propagation or
chain reaction makes all valuation impossible. Once again we are put in mind
of microphysics: it is as impossible to make estimations between beautiful

and ugly, true and false, or good and evil, as it is simultaneously to calculate a
particle's speed and position. Good is no longer the opposite of evil, nothing
can now be plotted on a graph or analysed in terms of abscissas and ordinates .
Just a s each particle follows its own trajectory, each value o r fragment o f value
shines for a moment in the heavens of simulation, then disappears into the
void along a crooked path that only rarely happens to intersect with other such
paths. This is the pattern of the fractal - and hence the current pattern of our
culture .
When things, signs or actions are freed from their respective ideas, concepts,
essences, values, points of reference, origins and aims, they embark upon an
endless process of self-reproduction. Yet things continue to function long after
their ideas have disappeared, and they do so in total indifference to their own
content. The paradoxical fact is that they function even better under these
circumstances.
Thus, for example, the idea of progress has disappeared, yet progress
continues. The idea of wealth that production once connoted has disappeared,
yet production itself continues more vigorously than ever. Indeed, it picks up
speed precisely in proportion to its increasing indifference to its original aims.
Of the political sphere one can say that the idea of politics has disappeared but
that the game of politics continues in secret indifference to its own stakes. Of
television, that it operates in total indifference to its own images (it would not
be affected, in other words, even were mankind to disappear) . Could it be that
all systems, all individuals, harbour a secret urge to be rid of their ideas, of their
own essences, so as to be able to proliferate everywhere, to transport them­
selves simultaneously to every point of the compass? In any event, the
consequences of a dissociation of this kind can only be fatal. A thing which has
lost its idea is like the man who has lost his shadow, and it must either fall
under the sway of madness or perish.

This is where the order (or rather, disorder) of metastasis begins - the rule of
propagation through mere contiguity, of cancerous proliferation (even the
genetic code of value having lost any force) . On all sides we witness a kind of
fading away of sexuality, of sexual beings, in favour of a return to the earlier (?)
stage of immortal and asexual beings reproducing, like protozoa, by simple
division of the One into two and the transmission of a code. Today's techno­
logical beings - machines, clones, replacement body parts - all tend towards
this kind of reproduction, and little by little they are imparting the same
process to those beings that are supposedly human, and sexed. The aim
everywhere - not least at the leading edge of biological research - is to effect a
genetic substitution of this kind, to achieve the linear and sequential reproduc­
tion, cloning or parthenogenesis of little celibate machines.
When sexual liberation was the order of the day, the watchword was
'Maximize sexuality, minimize reproduction' . The dream of our present clone­
loving society is just the opposite: as much . reproduction and as little sex as
possible. At one time the body was a metaphor for the soul, then it became a
metaphor for sex. Today it is no longer a metaphor for anything at all, merely
the locus of metastasis, of the machine-like connections between all its pro­
cesses, of an endless programming devoid of any symbolic organization or
overarching purpose: the body is thus given over to the pure promiscuity of its
relationship to itself - the same promiscuity that characterizes networks and
integrated circuits.
The possibility of metaphor is disappearing in every sphere. This is an
aspect of a general tendency towards transsexuality which extends well
beyond sex, affecting all disciplines as they lose their specificity and partake of
a process of confusion and contagion - a viral loss of determinacy which is the
prime event among all the new events that assail us. Economics becomes
transeconomics, aesthetics becomes transaesthetics, sex becomes transsexua­
lity - all converge in a transversal and universal process wherein no discourse
may have a metaphorical relationship to another, because for there to be

metaphor, differential fields and distinct objects must exist. But they cannot
exist where contamination is possible between any discipline and any other.
Total metonymy, then - viral by definition (or lack of definition) . The viral
analogy is not an importation from biology, for everything is affected simulta­
neously and under the same terms by the virulence in question, by the chain
reaction we have been discussing, by haphazard and senseless proliferation
and metastasis. Perhaps our melancholy stems from this, for metaphor still had
its beauty; it was aesthetic, playing as it did upon difference, and upon the
illusion of difference . Today, metonymy - replacing the whole as well as the
components, and occasioning a general commutability of terms - has built its
house upon the dis-illusion of metaphor.
Thus every individual category is subj ect to contamination, substitution is
possible between any sphere and any other: there is a total confusion of types.
Sex is no longer located in sex itself, but elsewhere - everywhere else, in fact.
Politics is no longer restricted to the political sphere, but infects every sphere ­
economics, science, art, sport . . . Sport itself, meanwhile, is no longer located
in sport as such, but instead in business, in sex, in politics, in the general style
of performance. All these domains are affected by sport's criteria of 'excellence',
effort and record-breaking, as by its childish notion of self-transcendence. Each
category thus passes through a phase transition during which its essence is
diluted in homeopathic doses, infinitesimal relative to the total solution, until it
finally disappears, leaving a trace so small as to be indiscernible, like the
'memory of water' .
AIDS is the reflection not so much of an excess of sex or sexual pleasure as
of sex's decompensation through its general spread into all areas of life, its
venting through all the trivial variants of sexual incantation. The real loss of
immunity concerns sex as a whole, with the disappearance of sexual difference
and hence of sexuality per se. It is in this diffraction of the sexual reality

principle, at the fractal, micrological and non-human level, that the essential
confusion of the epidemic takes hold.
Perhaps we still have a memory of sex, rather as water 'remembers'
molecules no matter how diluted . But that is the whole point: this is only a
molecular memory, the corpuscular memory of an earlier life, and not a
memory of forms or singularities (water, after all, can hardly retain the features
of a face, or the colour of someone's eyes). So what we are left with is the simple
imprint of a faceless sexuality infinitely watered down in a broth of politics,
media and communications, and eventually manifested in the viral explosion
of AIDS.
The law that is imposed on us is the law of the confusion of categories.
Everything is sexual. Everything is political. Everything is aesthetic. All at
once. Everything has acquired a political meaning, especially since 1968; and it
is not just everyday life but also madness, language, the media, even desire,
that are politicized as they enter the sphere of liberation, the sphere of mass
processes. Likewise everything has become sexual, anything can be an object
of desire: power, knowledge - everything is interpreted in terms of phantasies,
in terms of repression, and sexual stereotypy reigns in every last corner.
Likewise, too, everything is now aestheticized: politics is aestheticized in the
spectacle, sex in advertising and porn, and all kinds of activity in what is
conventionally referred to as culture - a sort of all-pervasive media- and
advertising-led semiologization: 'culture degree Xerox' . Each category is
generalized to the greatest possible extent, so that it eventually loses all
specificity and is reabsorbed by all the other categories. When everything is
political, nothing is political any more, the word itself is meaningless. When
everything is sexual, nothing is sexual any more, and sex loses its determi­
nants. When everything is aesthetic, nothing is beautiful or ugly any more, and
art itself disappears. This paradoxical state of affairs, which is simultaneously
the complete actualization of an idea, the perfect realization of the whole
tendency of modernity, and the negation of that idea and that tendency, their

annihilation by virtue of their very success, by virtue of their extension beyond
their own bounds - this state of affairs is epitomized by a single figure : the
transpolitical, the transsexual, the transaesthetic.
There is no longer an avant-garde, political, sexual or artistic, embodying a
capacity for anticipation; hence the possibility of any radical critique - whether
in the name of desire, of revolution, or of the liberation of forms - no longer
exists. The days of that revolutionary movement are gone . The glorious march
of modernity has not led to the transformation of all values, as we once
dreamed it would, but instead to a dispersal and involution of value whose
upshot for us is total confusion - the impossibility of apprehending any
determining principle, whether of an aesthetic, a sexual or a political kind.
The proletariat has not succeeded in negating itself as such - the century
and a half since Marx has made that clear. The proletariat has failed to negate
itself qua class and thereby abolish class society per se. Perhaps this is because
the proletariat never was a class, as had been supposed - because only the
bourgeoisie was a true Class, and therefore the only one capable of negating
itself as such . For it has indeed negated itself, along with capital, and so
generated a classless society, albeit one which has nothing to do with the
classless society that was supposed to arise from a revolution and from a
negation of the proletariat as such. As for the proletariat, it has simply
disappeared - vanished along with the class struggle itself. There can be no
doubt that had capitalism developed in accordance with its own contradictory
logic, it would have been defeated by the proletariat. In an ideal sense, Marx's
analysis is still irreproachable. But Marx simply did not foresee that it would be
possible for capital, in the face of the imminent threat to its existence, to
transpoliticize itself, as it were: to launch itself into an orbit beyond the
relations of production and political contradictions, to make itself autonomous
in a free-floating, ecstatic and haphazard form, and thus to totalize the world in
its own image . Capital (if it may still be so called) has barred the way of political

economy and the law of value; it is in this sense that it has successfully escaped
its own end. Henceforward it can function independently of its own former
aims, and absolutely without reference to any aims whatsoever. The inaugural
event of this mutation was undoubtedly the Great Crash of 1929; the stock­
market crisis of 1987 was merely an aftershock.
Revolutionary theory also enshrined the living utopian hope that the State
would wither away, and that the political sphere would negate itself as such, in
the apotheosis of a finally transparent social realm. None of this has come to
pass. The political sphere has disappeared, sure enough - but so far from doing
so by means of a self-transcendence into the strictly social realm, it has carried
that realm into oblivion with it. We are now in the transpolitical sphere; in
other words, we have reached the zero point of politics, a stage which also
implies the reproduction of politics, its endless simulation. For everything that
has not successfully transcended itself can only fall prey to revivals without
end. So politics will never finish disappearing - nor will it allow anything else
to emerge in its place. A kind of hysteresis of the political reigns.
Art has likewise failed to realize the utopian aesthetic of modern times, to
transcend itself and become an ideal form of life. (In earlier times, of course, art
had no need of self-transcendence, no need to become a totality, for such a
totality already existed - in the shape of religion.) Instead of being subsumed in
a transcendent ideality, art has been dissolved within a general aestheticization
of everyday life, giving way to a pure circulation of images, a transaesthetics of
banality. Indeed, art took this route even before capital, for if the decisive
political event was the strategic crisis of 1929, whereby capital debouched into
the era of mass trans politics, the crucial moment for art was undoubtedly that
of Dada and Duchamp, that moment when art, by renouncing its own
aesthetic rules of the game, debouched into the transaesthetic era of the
banality of the image.
Nor has the promised sexual utopia materialized. This was to have con­
sisted in the self-negation of sex as a separate activity and its self-realization as

total life. The partisans of sexual liberation continue to dream this dream of
desire as a totality fulfilled within each of us, masculine and feminine at once,
this dream of sexuality as an assumption of desire beyond the difference
between the sexes. In point of fact sexual liberation has succeeded only in
helping sexuality achieve autonomy as an undifferentiated circulation of the
signs of sex. Although we are certainly in transition towards a transsexual state
of affairs, this has nothing to do with a revolution of life through sex - and
everything to do with a confusion and promiscuity that open the door to
virtual indifference (in all senses of the word) in the sexual realm.
Similarly, is not the triumph of communication and information the result
of the impossibility of a self-transcendence of the social relationship qua
alienated relationship? Failing any such transcendence, this relationship can
only reiterate itself through communication, proliferating in the proliferation
of networks and submitting to the lack of differentiation that characterizes
these. Communication is more social than the social itself: it is the hyper­
relational, sociality overactivated by social techniques . The social, in its
essence, is not this. Rather, it was a dream, a myth, a utopia, a conflicted and
contradictory form, a violent form - and, certainly, an occasional and excep­
tional occurrence . Communication, by banalizing the interface, plunges the
social into an undifferentiated state . That is why there is no such thing as a
communicational utopia. To conceive of a utopian society based on communi­
cation is an impossibility, because communication results, precisely, from a
society's inability to transcend itself as a function of new aims. The same goes
for information: excess knowledge is dispersed arbitrarily in every direction on
the surface, but commutation is the only process to which it is subject. At the
interfaces, interlocutors are connected up to one another after the fashion of an
electric plug in a socket. Communication 'occurs' by means of a sole instanta­
neous circuit, and for it to be 'good' communication it must take place fast ­
there is no time for silence. Silence is banished from our screens; it has no place
in communication. Media images (and media texts resemble media images in

every way) never fall silent: images and messages must follow one upon the
other without interruption. But silence is exactly that - a blip in the circuitry,
that minor catastrophe, that slip which, on television for instance, becomes
highly meaningful - a break laden now with anxiety, now with jubilation,
which confirms the fact that all this communication is basically nothing but a
rigid script, an uninterrupted fiction designed to free us not only from the void
of the television screen but equally from the void of our own mental screen,
whose images we wait on with the same fascination. One day the image of a
person sitting watching a television screen voided by a technicians' strike will
be seen as the perfect epitome of the anthropological reality of the twentieth
century.

TRANSAESTHETICS

We see Art proliferating wherever we turn; talk about Art is increasing even
more rapidly. But the soul of Art - Art as adventure, Art with its power of
illusion, its capacity for negating reality, for setting up an 'other scene' in
opposition to reality, where things obey a higher set of rules, a transcendent
figure in which beings, like line and colour on a canvas, are apt to lose their
meaning, to extend themselves beyond their own raison d'€tre, and, in an
urgent process of seduction, to rediscover their ideal form (even though this
form may be that of their own destruction) - in this sense, Art is gone. Art has
disappeared as a symbolic pact, as something thus clearly distinct from that
pure and simple production of aesthetic values, that proliferation of signs ad
infinitum, that recycling of past and present forms, which we call 'culture' .
There are no more fundamental rules, no more criteria of judgement or of
pleasure. In the aesthetic realm of today there is no longer any God to
recognize his own. Or, to use a different metaphor, there is no gold standard of
aesthetic judgement or pleasure . The situation resembles that of a currency

which may not be exchanged : it can only float, its only reference itself,
impossible to convert into real value or wealth.
Art, too, must circulate at top speed, and is impossible to exchange.
'Works' of art are indeed no longer exchanged, whether for each other or
against a referential value. They no longer have that secret collusiveness which
is the strength of a culture . We no longer read such works - we merely decode
them according to ever more contradictory criteria.
Nothing in this sphere conflicts with anything else. Neo-Geometrism,
Neo-Expressionism, New Abstraction, New Representationalism - all coexist
with a marvellous facility amid general indifference. It is only because none of
these tendencies has any soul of its own that they can all inhabit the same
cultural space; only because they arouse nothing but profound indifference in
us that we can accept them all simultaneously.
The art world presents a curious aspect. It is as though art and artistic
inspiration had entered a kind of stasis - as though everything which had
developed magnificently over several centuries had suddenly been immobi­
lized, paralysed by its own image and its own riches. Behind the whole
convulsive movement of modern art lies a kind of inertia, something that can
no longer transcend itself and has therefore turned in upon itself, merely
repeating itself at a faster and faster rate. On the one hand, then, a stasis of the
living form of art, and at the same time a proliferative tendency, wild hyper­
bole, and endless variations on all earlier forms (the life, moving of itself, of that
which is dead) . All this is logical enough: where there is stasis, there is
metastasis. When a living form becomes disordered, when (as in cancer) a
genetically determined set of rules ceases to function, the cells begin to
proliferate chaotically. Just as some biological disorders indicate a break in the
genetic code, so the present disorder in art may be interpreted as a fundamen­
tal break in the secret code of aesthetics.

By its liberation of form, line, colour, and aesthetic notions - as by its mixing up
of all cultures, all styles - our society has given rise to a general aestheticiza­
tion: all forms of culture - not excluding anti-cultural ones - are promoted and
all models of representation and anti-representation are taken on board.
Whereas art was once essentially a utopia - that is to say, ultimately unrealiz­
able - today this utopia has been realized : thanks to the media, computer
science and video technology, everyone is now potentially a creator. Even anti­
art, the most radical of artistic utopias, was realized once Duchamp had
mounted his bottle-dryer and Andy Warhol had wished he was a machine. All
the industrial machinery in the world has acquired an aesthetic dimension; all
the world's insignificance has been transfigured by the aestheticizing process.
It is often said that the West's great undertaking is the commercialization of
the whole world, the hitching of the fate of everything to the fate of the
commodity. That great undertaking will turn out rather to have been the
aestheticization of the whole world - its cosmopolitan spectacularization, its
transformation into images, its semiological organization. What we are wit­
nessing, beyond the materialist rule of the commodity, is a semio-urgy of
everything by means of advertising, the media, or images. No matter how
marginal, or banal, or even obscene it may be, everything is subj ect to
aestheticization, culturalization, museumification. Everything is said, every­
thing is exposed, everything acquires the force, or the manner, of a sign. The
system runs less on the surplus-value of the commodity than on the aesthetic
surplus-value of the sign.
There is much talk of a dematerialization of art, as evidenced, supposedly,
by minimalism, conceptual art, ephemeral art, anti-art and a whole aesthetic of
transparency, disappearance and disembodiment. In reality, however, what
has occurred is a materialization of aesthetics everywhere under an operational
form. It is indeed because of this that art has been obliged to minimalize itself,
to mime its own disappearance. It has been doing this for a century already,
duly obeying all the rules. Like all disappearing forms, art seeks to duplicate

itself by means of simulation, but it will nevertheless soon be gone, leaving
behind an immense museum of artificial art and abandoning the field comple­
tely to advertising.
A dizzying eclecticism of form, a dizzying eclecticism of pleasure - such,
already, was the agenda of the baroque. For the baroque, however, the vortex
of artifice has a fleshly aspect. Like the practitioners of the baroque, we too are
irrepressible creators of images, but secretly we are iconoclasts - not in the
sense that we destroy images, but in the sense that we manufacture a
profusion of images in which there is nothing to see. Most present-day images - be
they video images, paintings, products of the plastic arts, or audiovisual or
synthesized images - are literally images in which there is nothing to see . They
leave no trace, cast no shadow, and have no consequences. The only feeling
one gets from such images is that behind each one there is something that has
disappeared. The fascination of a monochromatic picture is the marvellous
absence of form - the erasure, though still in the form of art, of all aesthetic
syntax. Similarly, the fascination of transsexuality is the erasure - though in the
form of spectacle - of sexual difference. These are images that conceal nothing,
that reveal nothing - that have a kind of negative intensity. The only benefit of
a Campbell's soup can by Andy Warhol (and it is an immense benefit) is that it
releases us from the need to decide between beautiful and ugly, between real
and unreal, between transcendence and immanence. Just as Byzantine icons
made it possible to stop asking whether God existed - without, for all that,
ceasing to believe in him.
This is indeed the miraculous thing. Our images are like icons: they allow
us to go on believing in art while eluding the question of its existence. So
perhaps we ought to treat all present-day art as a set of rituals, and for ritual use
only; perhaps we ought to consider art solely from an anthropological stand­
point, without reference to any aesthetic judgement whatsoever. The implica­
tion is that we have returned to the cultural stage of primitive societies. (The

speculative fetishism of the art market itself partakes of the ritual of art's
transparency. )
We find ourselves in the realm either of ultra- or of infra-aesthetics. It is
pointless to try to endow our art with an aesthetic consistency or an aesthetic
teleology. That would be like looking for the blue of the sky at the level of
infrared and ultraviolet rays.
In this sense, therefore, inasmuch as we have access to neither the
beautiful nor the ugly, and are incapable of judging, we are condemned to
indifference. Beyond this indifference, however, another kind of fascination
emerges, a fascination which replaces aesthetic pleasure. For, once liberated
from their respective constraints, the beautiful and the ugly, in a sense,
multiply: they become more beautiful than beautiful, more ugly than ugly.
Thus painting currently cultivates, if not ugliness exactly - which remains an
aesthetic value - then the uglier-than-ugly (the 'bad', the 'worse', kitsch), an
ugliness raised to the second power because it is liberated from any relation­
ship with its opposite. Once freed from the 'true' Mondrian, we are at liberty to
'out-Mondrian Mondrian'; freed from the true na ifs , we can paint in a way that
is 'more na if than na if ', and so on. And once freed from reality, we can produce
the 'realer than real' - hyperrealism. It was in fact with hyperrealism and pop
art that everything began, that everyday life was raised to the ironic power of
photographic realism. Today this escalation has caught up every form of art,
every style; and all, without discrimination, have entered the transaesthetic
world of simulation.
There is a parallel to this escalation in the art market itself. Here too, because an
end has been put to any deference to the law of value, to the logic of
commodities, everything has become 'more expensive than expensive' expensive, as it were, squared. Prices are exorbitant - the bidding has gone
through the roof. Just as the abandonment of all aesthetic ground rules
provokes a kind of brush fire of aesthetic values, so the loss of all reference to

the laws of exchange means that the market hurtles into unrestrained
speculation.
The frenzy, the folly, the sheer excess are the same . The promotional
ignition of art is directly linked to the impossibility of all aesthetic evaluation.
In the absence of value judgements, value goes up in flames. And it goes up in
a sort of ecstasy.
There are two art markets today. One is still regulated by a hierarchy of
values, even if these are already of a speculative kind. The other resembles
nothing so much as floating and uncontrollable capital in the financial market:
it is pure speculation, movement for movement's sake, with no apparent
purpose other than to defy the law of value. This second art market has much
in common with poker or potlatch - it is a kind of space opera in the
hyperspace of value. Should we be scandalized? No. There is nothing immoral
here. Just as present-day art is beyond beautiful and ugly, the market, for its
part, is beyond good and evil.

TRANSSEXUALITY

The sexual body has now been assigned a kind of artificial fate. This fate is
transsexuality - 'transsexual' not in any anatomical sense, but rather in the
more general sense of transvestitism, of playing with the commutability of the
signs of sex - and of playing, in contrast to the former manner of playing on
sexual difference, on sexual indifference: on lack of differentiation between the
sexual poles, and on indifference to sex qua pleasure. Sexuality is underpinned
by pleasure, by jouissance (the leitmotiv of sexual liberation); trans sexuality is
underpinned by artifice - be it the artifice of actually changing sex or the artifice
of the transvestite who plays with the sartorial, morphological or gestural signs
of sex. But whether the operation in question is surgical or semio-urgical,
whether it involves organs or signs, we are in any case concerned with
replacement parts, and since today the body is fated to become a prosthesis, it
is logical enough that our model of sexuality should have become transsexua­
"
lity, and that transsexuality should have everywhere become the locus of
seduction.

We are all transsexuals, just as we are biological mutants in potentia. This is
not a biological issue, however: we are all transsexuals symbolically.
Take La Cicciolina. Is there any more marvellous incarnation of sex - of sex
in pornographic innocence? La Cicciolina has been contrasted with Madonna,
virgin fruit of the aerobic sphere, product of a glacial aesthetic, devoid of all
charm and all sensuality - a numbed android who by virtue of this very fact
was perfect raw material for a synthetic idol. But is not La Cicciolina too a
transsexual? Her long platinum hair, her customized breasts, her realer-than­
real curves worthy of an inflatable doll, her lyophilic eroticism borrowed from a
comic-strip or science-fiction world, and above all the hyperbole of her (never
perverse or libertine) sexual discourse - all conspire to offer a ready-made and
total sinfulness; La Cicciolina is the ideal woman of a telephone chat-line
complete with a carnivorous erotic ideology that no modern woman could
possibly espouse - except, that is, for a transsexual, or a transvestite, these
being the only people left who live through the signs of an overdrawn,
rapacious sexuality. La Cicciolina, as carnal ectoplasm, is here very close to
Madonna's artificial nitroglycerine or to Michael Jackson's androgynous and
Frankensteinian appeal. All of them are mutants, transvestites, genetically
baroque beings whose erotic look conceals their generic lack of specificity.
They are all gender-benders' - all turncoats of sex.
I

Consider Michael Jackson, for example. Michael Jackson is a solitary mutant, a
precursor of a hybridization that is perfect because it is universal - the race to
end all races. Today's young people have no problem with a miscegenated
society: they already inhabit such a universe, and Michael Jackson fore­
shadows what they see as an ideal future. Add to this the fact that Michael has
had his face lifted, his hair straightened, his skin lightened - in short, he has
been reconstructed with the greatest attention to detail. This is what makes
him such an innocent and pure child - the artificial hermaphrodite of the fable,

better able even than Christ to reign over the world and reconcile its contradic­
tions; better than a child-god because he is child-prosthesis, an embryo of all
those dreamt-of mutations that will deliver us from race and from sex.
One might also consider the transvestites of the aesthetic sphere - of
whom Andy Warhol must surely be the emblematic figure. Like Michael
Jackson, Andy Warhol is a solitary mutant - a precursor, for his part, of a
perfect and universal hybridization of art, of a new aesthetic to end all
aesthetics. Like Jackson, he is a perfectly artificial personality: he too is
innocent and pure, an androgyne of the new generation, a sort of mystical
prosthesis or artificial machine capable, thanks to its perfection, of releasing
us at one blow from the grip of both sex and aesthetics. When Warhol says:
all works are beautiful I don't have to choose between them because all
contemporary works are equivalent; when he says: art is everywhere, there­
fore it no longer exists, everyone is a genius, the world as it is, in its very
banality, is inhabited by genius - nobody is ready to believe him. Yet his is in
fact an accurate description of the shape of the modern aesthetic, an aesthetic
of radical agnosticism.
We are all agnostics, transvestites of art or of sex. None of us has either
aesthetic or sexual convictions any longer - yet we all profess to have them.
-

The myth of sexual liberation is still alive and well under many forms in the real
world, but at the level of the imaginary it is the transsexual myth, with its
androgynous and hermaphroditic variants, that holds sway. After the orgy,
then, a masked ball. After the demise of desire, a pell-mell diffusion of erotic
simulacra in every guise, of transsexual kitsch in all its glory. A postmodern
pornography, if you will, where sexuality is lost in the theatrical excess of its
ambiguity. Things have certainly changed since the days when sexuality and
politics constituted a single subversive project: if La Cicciolina can now be
elected to the Italian Parliament, this is precisely because the transsexual and
the transpolitical have combined within the same ironic indifference. This

performance, unthinkable just a few short years ago, testifies to the fact that it
is not just sexual culture but the whole of political culture that has now come
beneath the banner of transvestitism.
This strategy for exorcizing the body by means of the signs of sex, for
conjuring away desire through the overkill of its staging, is a good deal more
efficient than good old repression founded on taboo. But where this new
system really differs from the old is that one cannot see at all who stands to
gain from it - for everyone suffers from it equally. The rule of transvestitism
has become the very basis of our behaviour, even in our own search for identity
and difference. We no longer have time to search for an identity for ourselves
in the archives, in a memory, in a project or a future. Instead we are supposed
to have an instant memory to which we can plug in directly for immediate
access to a kind of public-relations identity. What is sought today is not so
much health, which is an organic equilibrium, as an ephemeral, hygienic and
promotional radiance from the body - much more a performance than an ideal
state . In terms of fashion and appearances, what we seek is less beauty or
attractiveness than the right look.
Everyone seeks their look. Since it is no longer possible to base any claim on
one's own existence, there is nothing for it but to perform an appearing act
without concerning oneself with being or even with being seen. So it is not: I
exist, I am here! but rather: I am visible, I am an image - look! look! This is not
even narcissism, merely an extraversion without depth, a sort of self-promot­
ing ingenuousness whereby everyone becomes the manager of their own
appearance.
The 'look' is a sort of minimal low-definition image, like a video image - or
what McLuhan would call a tactile image, an image which draws neithe.r
attention nor admiration - as fashion still does - but is no more than a special
effect, with no particular significance. The look is no longer a function of
fashion - it is a form of fashion that has been overtaken. It no longer even
appeals to a logic of distinction, it is no longer founded on an interplay of

differences: it plays at difference without believing in it. It is, in fact, indifference.
Being oneself has become a transient performance with no sequel, a disabused
mannerism in a world without manners.
The triumph of the transsexual and of transvestitism casts a strange light,
retrospectively, upon the sexual liberation espoused by an earlier generation. It
now appears that this liberation - which, according to its own discourse, meant
the bursting forth of the body's full erotic force, a process especially favourable
to the principles of femininity and of sexual pleasure - may actually have been
no more than an intermediate phase on the way to the confusion of categories
that we have been discussing. The sexual revolution may thus turn out to have
been just a stage in the genesis of transsexuality. What is at issue here,
fundamentally, is the problematic fate of all revolutions.
The cybernetic revolution, in view of the equivalence of brain and com­
puter, places humanity before the crucial question IAm I a man or a machine?'
The genetic revolution that is taking place at the moment raises the question
IAm I a man or just a potential clone?' The sexual revolution, by liberating all
the potentialities of desire, raises another fundamental question, 'Am I a man
or a woman?' (If it has done nothing else, psychoanalysis has certainly added
its weight to this principle of sexual uncertainty.) As for the political and social
revolution, the prototype for all the others, it will turn out to have led man by
an implacable logic - having offered him his own freedom, his own free will to ask himself where his own will lies, what he wants in his heart of hearts, and
what he is entitled to expect from himself. To these questions there are no
answers. Such is the paradoxical outcome of every revolution: revolution
opens the door to indeterminacy, anxiety and confusion. Once the orgy was
over, liberation was seen to have left everyone looking for their generic and
sexual identity - and with fewer and fewer answers available, in view of the
traffic in signs and the multiplicity of pleasures on offer. That is how we
became transsexuals - just as we became transpoliticals: in other words,

politically indifferent and undifferentiated beings, androgynous and her­
maphroditic - for by this time we had embraced, digested and rejected the
most contradictory ideologies, and were left wearing only their masks: we had
become, in our own heads - and perhaps unbeknownst to ourselves transvestites of the political realm.

TRANSECONOMICS

The interesting thing about the Wall Street crash of 1987 was the uncertainty
about it. Was it a true catastrophe? And is real catastrophe to be expected in the
future? Answer: there cannot be a real catastrophe because we live under the
sign of virtual catastrophe.
What did become crystal dear on this occasion was the discrepancy
between the economy as we imagine it to be and the economy as it really is. It is
this very discrepancy that protects us from a real catastrophe of the productive
economies.
Is it a good thing or a bad thing? There is a dear parallel here with the
discrepancy between orbital war and local wars. Local wars are carried on
everywhere, but nuclear war never breaks out. If there were no dear divide
between the two, nuclear showdown would have occurred long ago. We live in
the shadow of all kinds of 'bombs' that don't go off - virtual catastrophes that
never take place: an international stock-exchange and financial crash, nuclear
showdown, the Third World debt, the population time bomb . . . Of course,
one might say that all these bombs will indeed explode sooner or later - just as

California is bound, sometime in the next fifty years, to sink into the Pacific for
seismic reasons. But the simple fact is that we experience no such explosions .
Our only reality is an unchecked orbital whirl of capital which, when it does
crash, causes no substantial disequilibrium in real economies (in sharp contrast
to the crisis of 1929, when the rift between imaginary and real economies was
far narrower). The reason, no doubt, is that the realm of mobile and speculative
capital has achieved so great an autonomy that even its cataclysms leave no
traces.
Where they do leave a mark - and a murderously destructive one - is in
economic theory itself, which has been completely disarmed by the disin­
tegration of its object of study. The same goes for the theorists of war. They too
have a bomb that doesn't go off, while war itself has become two different
things: on the one hand a total but virtual war, an orbital war; on the other
hand a multiplicity of real wars at ground level. The two are quite different in
scale, and do not obey the same rules - much like the virtual and the real
economies. We simply have to get used to this split, to a world dominated by
this distortion. Of course, there really was a crisis in 1929, and Hiroshima really
happened, so both financial crashes and nuclear bombs have had their respect­
ive moments of truth. But there has been no series of increasingly serious
crashes (as Marx predicted), nor has war gone from one nuclear showdown to
the next. In each case, there was one event - and that was that. The sequel has
been something else entirely: both big financial capital and the means of
destruction have been 'hyper-realized' - and both are now in orbit above our
heads on courses which not only escape our control but, by the same token,
escape from reality itself. War hyper-realized and money hyper-realized circu­
late alike in a space which is inaccessible - but which consequently leaves the
world just as it is. The upshot is that our (real) economies continue to produce,
even though the slightest logical consequence of the fluctuations occurring in
our imagined economy would have sufficed to destroy them utterly (we
should not forget that the total volume of trade currently represents a mere

forty-fifth of the total movement of capital) . Similarly, the world continues to
exist even though the detonation of a thousandth part of the available nuclear
explosives would have reduced it to nothing. The Third World and the
developed world continue to survive, even though the most minimal gesture
in the direction of auditing the one's debt to the other would effectively bring
all trade to a halt. Furthermore, this debt has itself already begun to go into
orbit, circulating from one bank to another, or from one country to another, as it
is bought and sold - indeed, this, no doubt, is how we will end up forgetting
about it altogether, and sending it definitively into orbit along with nuclear
waste and not a few other things. An ever-revolving debt, a lack of capital that
circulates, a negative wealth that will doubtless one day be quoted on the Stock
Exchange in its own right: true marvels!
When a debt becomes too cumbersome, then, it is banished to a virtual
space where it resembles a deep-frozen catastrophe in orbit. Debt becomes a
satellite of Earth, just like war, and just like the millions of dollars' worth of
floating capital now conglomerated into a satellite tirelessly circling us. And
surely this is for the best. Just so long as such satellites keep circulating - and
even if they explode out in space (like the 'lost' billions of the 1987 crash) - the
world is not affected by them, which is the best possible outcome. For the
suggestion that the imaginary economy and the real one might one day be
reconciled is a utopian one: those billions of floating dollars are untranslatable
into real economic terms - and that is just as well, because if, per mirabile, they
could be reinjected into productive economies, the result, for once, would be a
true catastrophe. Likewise the virtuality of war is best left in orbit - for it is from
there that it protects us: in its most abstract form, in its present monstrous
excentricity, nuclear capability is our best protection. We may as well accustom
ourselves to living in the shadow of such excrescences as the orbital bomb,
financial speculation, worldwide debt and overpopulation (for which last no
orbital solution has yet been found, though there is still hope) . Such as they

are, in their excessiveness, in their very hyper-reality, they are self-exorcizing,
and they leave the world in a sense intact, freed from the threat of its double.
Victor Segalen observed that from the moment we became certain that the
Earth was a sphere, travel ceased to exist - for to leave any point on the surface
of a sphere is also necessarily to begin the return to that same point. Linearity
on a sphere has a curve to it - the curve of monotony. From the moment when
the first astronauts began circling Earth, we each began secretly circling round
ourselves. The orbital era is here. Space is a part of it, but its expression par
excellence is television, as well as a good few other things, among them the
rondo of the molecular spirals of DNA within the recesses of our cells. The first
orbital space flights marked the completion of the process of globalization, but
also the moment when progress itself became circular, when the human
universe was reduced to a vast orbital machine. What Segalen called 'tourism'
could really begin: the perpetual tourism of people who no longer undertake
voyages in the true sense, but simply go round and round in circles within their
circumscribed territory. Exoticism was now dead and buried.
But Segalen's remark has a wider application. It is not just travel - that is to
say, the way in which the Earth is imagined - and not just the physics and
metaphysics of transcendence and discovery that have been erased in favour
of mere circulation, for everything which once aspired to transcendence, to
discovery, to the infinite, has subtly altered its aim so that it can go into orbit:
learning, technology, knowledge, having lost any transcendent aspect to their
projects, have begun planning orbital trajectories for themselves. 'Information'
is orbital, for example - a form of knowledge which will never again go beyond
itself, never again achieve transcendence or self-reflection in its aspiration
towards the infinite; yet which, for all that, never sets its feet on the ground, for
it has no true purchase on, nor referent in, reality. Information circulates,
moves around, makes its circuits (which are sometimes perfectly useless - but
that is the whole point: the question of usefulness cannot be raised) - and with

each spiral, each revolution, it accumulates. Television is an image which no
longer dreams, no longer imagines, but nevertheless has nothing whatsoever
to do with reality. An orbital circuit. The nuclear bomb, whether actually
satellite-borne or not, is also orbital: its trajectory must inevitably remain an
obsession for the planet, yet at the same time it is not supposed to come back
down to earth: this is no longer a finite bomb - nor a bomb that will even (we
must hope!) achieve its end; it is simply there, in its orbit, and the terror it
evokes - or at any rate, its power of dissuasion - is enough. It no longer even
fills our dreams with terror: destruction is unimaginable. The bomb is simply
there, in orbit, hanging over us, revolving for ever and ever. The same is true of
Eurodollars, and of the massive quantities of floating currency . . . Everything
tends to become a satellite - even our brains may be said to be outside us now,
floating around us in the countless Hertzian ramifications of waves and
circuits.
This is not science fiction, merely a generalization of McLuhan's theory of
the 'extensions of man' . Every aspect of human beings - their bodies in their
biological, mental, muscular or cerebral manifestations - now floats free in the
shape of mechanical or computer-aided replacement parts. McLuhan, how­
ever, conceives of all this as a positive expansion - as the universalization of
man - through media. This is a very sanguine view. The fact is that all the
functions of man's body, so far from gravitating around him in concentric order,
have become satellites ordered excentrically with respect to him. They have
gone into orbit on their own account; consequently it is man himself, in view of
this orbital extraversion of his own functions, his own technologies, who is
now in a position of ex-orbitation and ex-centricity. Vis-a-vis the satellites that
he has created and put into orbit, it is man with his planet Earth, with his
territory, with his body, who is now the satellite. Once transcendent, he has
become exorbitate.
It is not just the functions of man's body which, by becoming satellites,
make man himself into a satellite. All those functions of our societies - notably
30

the higher ones - which break off and go into orbit, contribute to the process.
Loan, finance, the technosphere, communications - all have become satellites
in an inaccessible space and left everything else to go to rack and ruin.
Whatever fails to achieve orbital power is left in a state of abandonment which
is permanent, since there is now no way out of it via some kind of
transcendence.
We are in the age of weightlessness. It is as though our model were a niche
in space whose kinetic energy cancels out our Earth's gravity. The centrifugal
force of our proliferating technologies has stripped us of all weight and
transferred us into an empty freedom of movement. Freed of all density, all
gravity, we are being dragged into an orbital motion which threatens to
become perpetual.
We are now governed not so much by growth as by growths. Ours is a society
founded on proliferation, on growth which continues even though it cannot be
measured against any clear goals. An excrescential society whose development
is uncontrollable, occurring without regard for self-definition, where the
accumulation of effects goes hand in hand with the disappearance of causes.
The upshot is gross systemic congestion and malfunction caused by hypertelia
- by an excess of functional imperatives, by a sort of saturation. There is no
better analogy here than the metastatic process in cancer: a loss of the body's
organic ground rules such that a given group of cells is able to deploy its
incoercible and murderous vitality, to defy genetic programming and to
proliferate endlessly.
This process is not a critical one : crisis is always a matter of causality, of an
imbalance between cause and effect to which a solution will be found (or not)
by attending to causes. In our case, by contrast, it is the causes themselves that
are tending to disappear, tending to become indecipherable, and giving way to
an intensification of processes operating in a void.

So long as there is a dysfunction in a system, a departure from known laws
governing its operation, there is always the prospect of transcending the
problem. But when a system rides roughshod over its own basic assumptions,
supersedes its own ends, so that no remedy can be found, then we are
contemplating not crisis but catastrophe. Deficiency is never a complete
disaster, but saturation is fatal, for it produces a sort of tetanized inertia.
The striking thing about all present-day systems is their bloatedness: the
means we have devised for handling data - communication, record-keeping,
storage, production and destruction - are all in a condition of demonic
pregnancy' (to borrow Susan Sontag's description of cancer). So lethargic are
they, indeed, that they will assuredly never again serve a useful purpose. It is
not we that have put an end to use-value - rather, the system itself has
eliminated it through surplus production. So many things have been produced
and accumulated that they can never possibly all be put to use (certainly not a
bad thing in the case of nuclear weapons) . So many messages and signals are
produced and disseminated that they can never possibly all be read. A good
thing for us too - for even with the tiny portion that we do manage to absorb,
we are in a state of permanent electrocution.
There is something particularly nauseating about this prodigious useless­
ness, about a proliferating yet hypertrophied world which cannot give birth to
anything. So many reports, archives, documents - and not a single idea
generated; so many plans, programmes, decisions - and not a single event
precipitated; so many sophisticated weapons produced - and no war declared!
This saturation goes way beyond the surplus that Bataille spoke of; all
societies have found some way to dispose of that through useless or sump­
tuous expense. There is no possible way for us to spend all that has been
accumulated - all we have in prospect is a slow or brutal decompensation, with
each factor of acceleration serving to create inertia, bringing us closer to
absolute inertia. What we call crisis is in fact a foreshadowing of this absolute
inertia.

We confront a paradoxical process, then, whose duality - tetanization and
inertia, acceleration in a void, overheated production with no attendant social
gains or aims - is a reflection of the two phenomena conventionally attributed
to the crisis: inflation and unemployment.
Traditionally, inflation and unemployment are variables in the equation of
growth. At this level, however, there is really no question of crisis : these
phenomena are anomic in character, and anomie is merely the shadow cast by
an organic solidarity. What is worrying, by contrast, is anomaly. The anomalous
is not a clear symptom but, rather, a strange sign of failure, of the infraction of a
rule which is secret - or which, at any rate, we know nothing about. Perhaps an
excess of goals is the culprit - we simply do not know. Something escapes us,
and we are escaping from ourselves, or losing ourselves, as part of an
irreversible process; we have now passed some point of no return, the point
where the contradictoriness of things ended, and we find ourselves, still alive,
in a universe of non-contradiction, of enthusiasm, of ecstasy - of stupor in the
face of a process which, for all its irreversibility, is bereft of meaning.
There is something much more shattering than inflation, however, and
that is the mass of floating money whirling about the Earth in an orbital rondo.
Money is now the only genuine artificial satellite. A pure artifact, it enjoys a
truly astral mobility; and it is instantaneously convertible. Money has now
found its proper place, a place far more wondrous than the stock exchange : the
orbit in which it rises and sets like some artificial sun.
Unemployment, too, has taken on new meaning. It is no longer a strategy
of capital (the reserve army of labour). It is no longer a critical factor in the play
of social relationships - if it were, since the danger level was passed long ago, it
would necessarily have sparked unprecedented upheavals. What is unem­
ployment today? It too is a sort of artificial satellite, a satellite of inertia, a mass
with a charge of electricity that cannot even be described as a negative charge,
for it is static: I refer to that increasingly large portion of society that is deep­
frozen. Beneath the accelerating pace of the circuits and systems of exchange,

beneath all the frenzied activity, there is something in us - in each of us - that
slows down to the point where it fades out of circulation. This is the inertia
point around which the whole of society eventually begins to gravitate. It is as
though the two poles of our world had been brought into contact, short­
circuiting in such a way that they simultaneously hyperstimulate and enervate
potential energies. This is no longer a crisis, but a fatal development - a
catastrophe in slow motion.
Not the least of paradoxes, given this context, is to see the economy returning
triumphantly to the agenda - though whether we can properly speak of
'economy' here is questionable. Certainly this glaring reality of today cannot
have the meaning it had in the classical or Marxist accounts. Its motor is neither
the infrastructure nor the superstructure of material production, but rather the
destructuring of value, the destabilization of real markets and economies and
the victory of an economy unencumbered by ideologies, by social science, by
history - an economy freed from 'Economics' and given over to pure specula­
tion; a virtual economy emancipated from real economies (not emancipated in
reality, of course: we are talking about virtuality - but that is the point, too:
today, power lies not in the real but in the virtual); and an economy which is
viral, and which thus connects with all other viral processes. If the economic
sphere has once more become an exemplary theatre of our present reality, it
has done so as the locus of special effects, of unforeseeable events, of an
irrational interplay of forces.
Along with Marx, we too dreamt of the end of Political Economy - of the
abolition of classes and the advent of a transparent social realm in accordance
with the ineluctable logic of Capital. And then we dreamt of the end of the
economy in terms of a disavowal of its basic tenets - a disavowal that threw out
the Marxist critique into the bargain: on this view, primacy was accorded
neither to the economic nor to the political - the economy was simply ushered
34

out as a mere epiphenomenon, vanquished by its simulacrum of itself, and by a
superior logic.
Today we no longer even need to dream: Political Economy is coming to an
end before our eyes, metamorphosing into a transeconomics of speculation
which merely plays at obeying the old logic (the law of value, the laws of the
market, production, surplus-value, all the classical laws of capital) and there­
fore no longer has anything economic or political about it. A game and nothing
but a game, with floating and arbitrary rules : a game of catastrophe.
So Political Economy will indeed soon have come to an end - though not at
all in the way we once envisaged : rather, through the exacerbation of its own
logic to the point of self-parody.
Speculation is not surplus-value, it is a sort of ecstasy of value, utterly
detached from production and its real conditions: a pure, empty form, the
purged form of value operating on nothing but its own revolving motion, its
own orbital circulation. The self-destabilization of Political Economy is thus
what puts paid, in monstrous and somehow ironic fashion, to all possible
alternatives. What possible riposte could there be to such extravagance, which
effectively co-opts the energy of poker, of potlatch, of the I accursed share', and
in a way opens the door to Political Economy's aesthetic and delusional stage?
This unexpected demise, this phase transition, this wild bull market, is
fundamentally far more original than all our old political utopias.

transvestitism as forms that are sexual and, in a general way, aesthetic. These
forms, and these forms alone, are what fascinate us today. Nobody is now the
slightest bit interested in sexual liberation, political discussion, organic ill­
nesses, or even conventional warfare (a fact for which we may be grateful so far
as war is concerned: a good many wars will not have taken place merely
because they held no interest for anyone). Our true phantasies lie elsewhere ­
specifically, they focus on the three above-mentioned forms, each of which
arises from the skewing of a basic operating principle and the confusion that
results from this. These forms, terrorism, transvestitism, and cancer, all reflect
excesses - on the political, sexual and genetic levels respectively; they also
reflect deficiencies in - and the consequent collapse of - the codes of the
political, sexual and genetic realms.
All these forms are viral - fascinating, indiscriminate - and their virulence
is reinforced by their images, for the modern media have a viral force of their

own, and their virulence is contagious . Ours is a culture in which bodies and
minds are irradiated by signals and images; little wonder, then, that for all its
marvels this culture also produces the most murderous viruses. The nucleari­
zation of our bodies began with Hiroshima, but it continues endemically,
incessantly, in the shape of our irradiation by media, signs, programs,
networks.
We are subject to a veritable bombardment by 'superconductive' events - by
the kind of untimely intercontinental whirlwinds which no longer affect just
states, individuals or institutions, but rather entire transversal structures: sex,
money, information, communications, etc.
This is not to say that AIDS, financial crashes, computer viruses and
terrorism are somehow interchangeable, merely that they do have a family
resemblance . Thus AIDS is certainly a sort of crash in sexual values, while
computers played a 'virulent' role in the Wall Street crash of 1987; meanwhile
computers are themselves at risk of viral infection - of 'crashes' in the
information market. Moreover, infection is no longer confined within a given
system but can leap from one system to another. All these tendencies revolve
around one generic scenario - that of catastrophe . Of course, the signs of
trouble have long been apparent: AIDS has long since entered its endemic
stage; the threat of financial crisis has been ever present since the celebrated
precedent of 1929; and computer pirates and electronic accidents have already
been with us for over twenty years. But the conjunction of all these endemic
forms and their almost simultaneous transition to a state of full-blown anomaly
have brought about a unique state of affairs. Their respective effects are not
necessarily of the same order in the popular consciousness: AIDS can, of
course, be experienced as a genuine catastrophe; the stock-market crash
seems, by contrast, like a kind of playing at catastrophe; as for computer
viruses, for all their dramatic consequences there is poetic justice here, and

when a sudden epidemic strikes the computer world, a common and not
incomprehensible reaction (except among computer professionals) is hilarity.
The general effect is reinforced by other factors too. Art, which is every­
where susceptible to fraud, to copying, to simulation, and at the same time to
the raving hyperbole of the art market, epitomizes a body irradiated by lucre.
Consider terrorism. Nothing more closely resembles the chain reaction of
terrorism in our irradiated societies than the chain reactions associated with
AIDS, with Wall Street raiders or with software saboteurs . (And, by the way,
what are these societies irradiated by? By the superfusion of happiness and
security, information and communication? By the disintegration of symbolic
nexuses, fundamental rules, or social contracts? It is anybody's guess.) The
contagiousness of terrorism, its fascination, is every bit as enigmatic as the
contagiousness of these other phenomena. When a programmer introduces a
'soft bomb' into his software and uses his resultant destructive power as a
threat, is he not in effect taking the program and all its applications hostage?
Likewise, are corporate raiders not taking and holding businesses hostage
when they speculate on their demise or resurrection in the stock market? All
these phenomena operate on the same model as terrorism (hostages have a
quoted price just like shares or pictures), but one might just as easily explain
terrorism in terms of a parallel with AIDS, with computer viruses, or with
public stock offerings. No phenomenon in this constellation of phenomena has
priority vis-ii-vis the others. (Consider the recent release of an informational
diskette on AIDS which was itself infected by a computer virus.)
Science fiction? Hardly. In the spheres of information and communication,
too, the value of the message is purely that of its circulation, its passage from
one image to another, one screen to another. We all get pleasure from this new
centrifugal value - from the stock exchange, the art market or corporate raiders
as spectacle . We all enjoy these things as spectacular breathing spaces under
capitalism, as by-products of capital's aesthetic delusions. And we delight in
the system's secret pathology, in the viruses that batten on its splendid

machinery and send it haywire. In fact, however, the viruses are part and
parcel of the hyperlogical consistency of our systems; they follow all the
pathways of those systems, and even open up new ones (computer viruses
explore possibilities of networks that were never anticipated by those
networks' designers) . Electronic viruses are an expression of the murderous
transparency of information on a world scale. AIDS is the product of the
murderous transparency of sex affecting entire human groups. Stock-market
crashes reflect the murderous transparency of economies with respect to one
another and the astounding circulation of values that is the very basis of the
liberation of production and exchange. Once 'liberated', all these processes
undergo a kind of superfusion much like nuclear superfusion, which is in fact
their prototype. This superfusion of chains of events is not the least of the
charms of our time.
Nor, if the succession of events exercises a charm, is unpredictability by any
means the least part of it. When a forecast is made, no matter what it may be, it
is always tempting to prove it wrong. Events themselves often help us out in
this regard. There are overpredicted events, for instance, that obligingly
decline to occur; and then there are the exactly opposite kind - those which
occur without forewarning. It behoves us to bank on such conjunctural
surprises - such 'backdraughts' . We must bet on the Witz of events them­
selves. If we lose, at least we shall have had the satisfaction of defying the
objective idiocy of the probabilities. This obligation is a vital function - part of
our collective genetic heritage . Indeed, this is the only genuine function of the
intellect: to embrace contradictions, to exercise irony, to take the opposite tack,
to exploit rifts and reversibility - even to fly in the face of the lawful and the
factual. If the intellectuals of today seem to have run out of things to say, this is
because they have failed to assume this ironic function, confining themselves
within the limits of their moral, political or philosophical consciousness
despite the fact that the rules have changed, that all irony, all radical criticism

now belongs exclusively to the haphazard, the viral, the catastrophic - to
accidental or system-led reversals. Such are the new rules of the game - such is
the new principle of uncertainty that now holds sway over all. The operation of
this principle is a source of intense intellectual satisfaction (no doubt even of
spiritual satisfaction) . Think of the computer-virus story: something in us leaps
with joy when we hear of an event of this kind. It is not that we have a perverse
love of catastrophe - this is not the glee of the doomsayer proved right. No, it is
that there is a suggestion of fatality here - and fatality always provokes a
certain elation in us.
An outcome is fatal when the same sign presides over both the advent of
something and its demise, when the same star that gave hope leads eventually
to disaster, or (as in the case of computer viruses) when the logic that informs a
system's expansion then proceeds to devastate it. The fatal in this sense is the
opposite of the accidental. The accidental is peripheral to a system, whereas
fatality is immanent. (Not that fatality always means disaster: the unforesee­
able harvest of fate may also be enchantment.) It is quite conceivable that
something of this diabolic principle may be found at work - albeit in homeo­
pathically small doses - even in the slight anomalies or tiny malfunctions that
affect our statistical universe.
Can this Witz of events be counted on to come into play every time? Of
course not. But the point is precisely that one can never be sure of what is
plainly evident. When the truth is incontestable, it loses credibility on that
account; even science is liable to be caught short. There is nothing academic
about the thesis that statistical truths can always be refuted. On the contrary, it
is a hope put about by the evil genie of a quintessentially popular wisdom.
Once upon a time there was much talk of the apathy of the masses. Their
silence was the crucial fact for an earlier generation. Today, however, the
masses act not by deflection but by infection, tainting opinion polls and
forecasts with their multifarious phantasies. Their abstention and their silence
are no longer determining factors (that stage was still nihilistic); what counts

now is their use of the cogs in the workings of uncertainty. Where the masses
once sported with their voluntary servitude, they now sport with their invo­
luntary incertitude. Unbeknownst to the experts who scrutinize them and the
manipulators who believe they can influence them, they have grasped the fact
that politics is virtually dead, and that they now have a new game to play, just
as exciting as the ups and downs of the stock market. This game enables them
to make audiences, charismas, levels of prestige and the market prices of
images dance up and down with an intolerable facility. The masses had been
deliberately demoralized and de-ideologized in order that they might become
the live prey of probability theory, but now it is they who destabilize all images
and play games with political truth. They are merely playing as they have been
taught to play, speculating on the Bourse of statistics and images. This
speculation is total, and immoral, just like that of the financial speculators. In
the face of the idiotic certainty and inexorable banality of numbers, the masses
are an incarnation, on the margins, of the principle of uncertainty in the
sociological sphere. As the powers-that-be strive to organize their statistical
order (and the social order is now a statistical order), so it falls to the masses to
look, in clandestine fashion, to the interests of statistical disorder.
It is from this viral, diabolic, ironic and reversible posture of the masses that
we are perhaps entitled to expect some unprecedented development - some
Witz of the events themselves.
This society now produces only ill-defined events whose ultimate clarification
is unlikely. In earlier times an event was something that happened - now it is
something that is designed to happen. It occurs, therefore, as a virtual artifact,
as a reflection of pre-existing media-defined forms.
The virus that wreaked havoc for five hours in the US scientific and
military computer network may have been just a test (as Paul Virilio has
suggested) - an experiment carried out by American military intelligence itself:
an event at once stage-managed and simulated. Either a true accident, then,

bearing witness to the effective virulence of such viruses, or a total simulation,
showing that the most effective strategy today is calculated destabilization and
deception. The verdict is not yet in. Even if the hypothesis of an experimental
simulation were to be confirmed, moreover, this would in no way guarantee
that the process involved was under control. A test virus can always turn into a
killer virus. No one can control chain reactions of this kind, and any simulated
accident is potentially an accident of simulation. What is more, we know that
any natural accident or catastrophe may be claimed as a terrorist act, and vice
versa. There is no limit here to the hyperbole of hypotheses.
It is in this respect, in fact, that the whole system is globally terroristic. A
greater terror than the terror of violence and accident is the terror of uncer­
tainty and dissuasion. A few years ago a group that had staged a mock hold-up
was penalized more heavily than they would have been for an actual robbery:
the fact is that attacks on the reality principle itself constitute a graver offence
than real-life violence.
What is constant is an immense uncertainty, an uncertainty which lies at the
core of the present operational euphoria. The natural sciences were the first to
describe a panic situation of this kind: it is the disappearance of the respective
positions of subject and object at the experimental interface that has given rise
to a definitive state of uncertainty about the reality of the object and the
(objective) reality of knowledge. Science itself seems to have fallen under the
sway of its strange attractors. But the same goes for the economy, whose
resurrection is apparently bound up with the total unpredictability that now
reigns within it. Likewise the sudden expansion of data-handling techniques is
seemingly tied to the indefiniteness of the knowledge with which these
techniques are designed to deal.
Are all techniques of this kind actively engaged with the real world? It is
extremely doubtful. The aim of science and technology would seem to be much

more that of presenting us with a definitively unreal world, beyond all criteria
of truth and reality. The revolution of our time is the uncertainty revolution.
We are not ready to accept this. Paradoxically, however, we attempt to
escape from uncertainty by relying even more on information and communica­
tions systems, so merely aggravating the uncertainty itself. This is a forward
flight: the pursuit race of technology and its perverse effects, of man and his
clones, around a track in the form of a Moebius strip, has only just begun.

43

OPERATIONAL
WHITEWASH

The uncertainty to which we are subject results, paradoxically, from an excess
of positivity, from an ineluctable drop in the level of negativity. A kind of
leukaemia has taken hold of our societies - a kind of dissolution of negativity in
a perfused euphoria. Neither the French Revolution, nor the philosophy of the
Enlightenment, nor critical utopianism has found its fulfilment through the
supersession of contradictions, and if the problems they addressed have been
solved, this has been achieved by casting off the negative, by disseminating the
energies of everything condemned by society within a simulation entirely
given over to positivity and factitiousness, by instituting a definitively trans­
parent state of affairs. Ours is rather like the situation of the man who has lost
his shadow: either he has become transparent, and the light passes right
through him or, alternatively, he is lit from all angles, overexposed and
defenceless against all sources of light. We are similarly exposed on all sides to
the glare of technology, images and information, without any way of refracting
their rays; and we are doomed in consequence to a whitewashing of all activity
- whitewashed social relations, whitewashed bodies, whitewashed memory 44

in short, to a complete aseptic whiteness. Violence is whitewashed, history is
whitewashed, all as part of a vast enterprise of cosmetic surgery at whose
completion nothing will be left but a society for which, and individuals for
whom, all violence, all negativity, are strictly forbidden. In these circumstances
everything which is unable to relinquish its own identity is inevitably plunged
into a realm of radical uncertainty and endless simulation.
We are under the sway of a surgical compulsion that seeks to excise negative
characteristics and remodel things synthetically into ideal forms. Cosmetic
surgery: a face's chance configuration, its beauty or ugliness, its distinctive
traits, its negative traits - all these have to be corrected, so as to produce
something more beautiful than beautiful: an ideal face, a surgical face. Even
one's astrological sign, one' s birth sign, can now be revised so as to harmonize
star and lifestyle: once a utopian notion, the idea of an Institute of Zodiacal
Surgery where a few appropriate manipulations would affiliate you with your
chosen sign is now clearly realistic.
Even the sex to which we belong - that small portion of destiny still
remaining to us, that minimum of fatality and otherness - will be changeable at
will. Not to mention cosmetic surgery as applied to green spaces, to nature in
general, to genes, to events, to history (e.g. the French Revolution revised and
corrected - given a facelift under the banner of human rights) . Everything has
to become postsynchable according to criteria of optimal convenience and
compatibility. This inhuman formalization of face, speech, sex, body, will and
public opinion is a tendency everywhere in evidence. Every last glimmer of
fate and negativity has to be expunged in favour of something resembling the
smile of a corpse in a funeral home, in favour of a general redemption of signs.
To this end a gigantic campaign of plastic surgery has been undertaken.
Everything has to be sacrificed to the principle that things must have an
operational genesis. So far as production is concerned, it is no longer the Earth

that produces, or labour that creates wealth (the famous betrothal of Earth and
Labour) : rather, it is Capital that makes the Earth and Labour produce. Work is
no longer an action, it is an operation. Consumption no longer means the
simple enjoyment of goods, it means having (someone) enjoy something - an
operation modelled on, and keyed to, the differential range of sign-objects.
Communication is a matter not of speaking but of making people speak.
Information involves not knowledge but making people know. The use of the
construction 'make' plus infinitive [in French, the auxiliary faire plus
infinitive - Trans.] indicates that these are operations, not actions. The point in
advertising and propaganda is not to believe but to make people believe.
'Participation' is not an active or spontaneous social form, because it is always
induced by some sort of machinery or machination: it is not acting so much as
making people act (an operation resembling animation or similar techniques).
These days even wanting is mediated by models of the will, by forms of
making people want something - by persuasion or dissuasion. Even if such
categories as wishing, being able, believing, knowing, acting, desiring and
enjoying still retain some meaning, they have all been monopolized, as it were,
by a simple auxiliary mode. Everywhere the active verb has given way to the
factitive, and actions themselves have less importance than the fact that they
are produced, induced, solicited, media-ized or technicized.
There is to be no knowledge save that which results from having (people)
know. No speaking save that which results from having (people) speak - i.e.
from an act of communication. No more actions save those which result from
an interaction - complete, if possible, with television monitor and built-in
feedback. For the thing that characterizes operation, as opposed to action, is
precisely that operations are necessarily regulated in the way in which they
occur - otherwise, there would be no communication. Speaking - but no
communication. Communication is operational or it is nothing. Information is
operational or it is nothing.

All our categories have thus entered the age of the factitious: no more
wanting - only getting people to want; no more doing - only getting people to
do; no more being worth something - merely getting something to be worth
something (witness advertising in general); no more knowing - only letting
know; and, last but not least, not so much enjoying, not so much taking
pleasure, as getting people to enj oy, getting people to take pleasure. This is the
great problem of the moment: to take sexual pleasure serves no purpose - we
are supposed to give sexual pleasure, whether to ourselves or to others. Such
pleasure has become an act of communication: I am your guest, you are my
guest - we exchange pleasure as part of a performative interactivity. Anyone
who seeks gratification without communication is a pig. Do communication
machines have orgasms? That is another story - but if we try to imagine
orgasmic machines, we can do so only by reference to the model of communi­
cation machines. As a matter of fact, such orgasmic machines already exist in
the shape of our own bodies - bodies coaxed into coming by the subtlest of
cosmetic and pleasure-inducing technologies.
Jogging is another activity in the thrall of the performance principle. To jog is
not to run but to make one's body run. Though it is based on the body's
informal performance, jogging strives to exhaust and destroy the body. The
'secondary state' induced by the activity corresponds exactly to this second
operation, this mechanical derailing of the body. The pleasure (or pain) of
jogging has nothing to do either with sport or with the body in its fleshly
reality: it is the pleasure not of pure physical exertion but of a dematerializa­
tion, of an endless functioning. The body of the jogger is like one of Tinguely's
machines: ascesis and ecstasis of the performance principle. Making the body
run soon gives way, moreover, to letting the body run: the body is hypnotized
by its own performance and goes on running on its own, in the absence of a
subject, like a somnambulistic and celibate machine. (An analogous machine

here is Jarry's quintuplette, on which the dead carry on pedalling by them­
selves.) The interminable aspect of jogging, like the interminable aspect of
psychoanalysis, is indeed endless, aimless, illusionless performance.
It can no longer be said that the goal here is 'getting into shape', which was
an ideal of the 1960s and 1970s . Fitness then was still functional: it represented
a striving for market value, for the body's sign-value, its productivity or status.
Performance, by contrast, is operational: it is orientated not towards the body's
form but towards its formula - its equation, its potentiality as a field of
operations, as something that we cause to function because, just like any
machine, it asks to be activated; because, just like any signal, it asks to be
switched on. It is just as simple as that. Hence the deep vacuousness of the
action's content. What could be vainer than all this running for the sake of
exercising the faculty of running? And still they run . . .
The same indifference to content, the same obsessional and operational,
performative and interminable aspects, also characterize the present-day use
of computers: people no more think at a computer than they run when j ogging.
They have their brain function in the first activity much as they have their body
run in the second. Here too the operation is virtually endless: a head-to-head
confrontation with a computer has no more reason to come to an end than the
physical effort that jogging demands. And the kind of hypnotic pleasure
involved, the ecstatic absorption or resorption of energy - bodily energy in one
case, cerebral in the other - is identical. On the one hand, the static electricity of
skin and muscles - on the other, the static electricity of the screen.
Jogging and working at a computer may be looked upon as drugs, as
narcotics, to the extent that all drugs are directly governed by the dominant
performance principle: they get us to take pleasure, get us to dream, get us to
feel. Drugs are not artificial in the sense of inducing a secondary state distinct
from a natural state of the body; they are artificial, however, in that they

constitute a chemical prosthesis, a mental surgery of performance, a plastic
surgery of perception.
It is hardly surprising that the suspicion of systematic drug use hangs over
sport today. Different forms of obeisance to the performance principle can
easily set up house together. Not only muscles and nerves but also neurons
and cells must be made to perform. (Even bacteria will soon have an operatio­
nal role .) Throwing, running, swimming and jumping have had their day: the
point now is to send a satellite called 'the body' into artificial orbit. The athlete's
body has become both launcher and satellite; no longer governed by an
individual will gauging the effort expended with a view to self-transcendence,
it is controlled by an internal microcomputer working by calculation alone.
The compulsion to operationalism gives rise to an operational paradox. It is not
just that the order of the day is 'making something worth something' : the fact
is that it is better, if something is to be invested with value, for it to have no
value to begin with; better to know nothing in order to have things known;
better to produce nothing in order to have things produced; and better to have
nothing to say if one seeks to communicate. All of which is part of the logic of
things: as everyone knows, if you want to make people laugh, it is better not to
be funny. The implications for communication and information networks are
incontestable: in order for content to be conveyed as well and as quickly as
possible, that content should come as close as possible to transparency and
insignificance. This principle may be seen in action in the telephone relation­
ship or in media transmissions - as also in more serious arenas. Thus good
communication - the foundation, today, of a good society - implies the
annihilation of its own content. (Note that even the term 'society' has lost its
meaning: the only thing that is still 'social' is whatever can be manufactured as
such, as 'sociality' or 'sociability' - ghastly sobriquets which perfectly express
the thing to which they refer: such terms - as Fran<;ois George has said of

'sexuality' - put one in mind of some form of surgery.) And if good communi­
cation implies the annihilation of its own content, good data-handling implies
a digital transparency of knowledge. Good advertising implies the nullity - or
at least the neutralization - of the product being advertised, just as fashion
implies the transparency of women and their bodies - and just as the exercise
of power implies the insignificance of those who exercise it.
What if all advertising were an apologia not for a product but for advertis­
ing itself? If information referred not to events but to the promotion of
information itself qua event? If communication were concerned not with
messages but instead with the promotion of communication itself qua myth?

XEROX AND INFINITY

If men create intelligent machines, or fantasize about them, it is either because
they secretly despair of their own intelligence or because they are in danger of
succumbing to the weight of a monstrous and useless intelligence which they
seek to exorcize by transferring it to machines, where they can play with it and
make fun of it. By entrusting this burdensome intelligence to machines we are
released from any responsibility to knowledge, much as entrusting power to
politicians allows us to disdain any aspiration of our own to power.
If men dream of machines that are unique, that are endowed with genius, it
is because they despair of their own uniqueness, or because they prefer to do
without it - to enjoy it by proxy, so to speak, thanks to machines. What such
machines offer is the spectacle of thought, and in manipulating them people
devote themselves more to the spectacle of thought than to thought itself.
It is not for nothing that they are described as 'virtual', for they put thought
on hold indefinitely, tying its emergence to the achievement of a complete
knowledge. The act of thinking itself is thus put off for ever. Indeed, the
question of thought can no more be raised than the question of the freedom of

future generations, who will pass through life as we travel through the air,
strapped into their seats. These Men of Artificial Intelligence will traverse their
own mental space bound hand and foot to their computers. Immobile in front
of his computer, Virtual Man makes love via the screen and gives lessons by
means of the teleconference. He is a physical - and no doubt also a mental ­
cripple. That is the price he pays for being operational. Just as eyeglasses and
contact lenses will arguably one day evolve into implanted prostheses for a
species that has lost its sight, it is similarly to be feared that artificial intelli­
gence and the hardware that supports it will become a mental prosthesis for a
species without the capacity for thought.
Artificial intelligence is devoid of intelligence because it is devoid of artifice.
True artifice is the artifice of the body in the throes of passion, the artifice of the
sign in seduction, the artifice of ambivalence in gesture, the artifice of ellipsis in
language, the artifice of the mask before the face, the artifice of the pithy
remark that completely alters meaning. So-called intelligent machines deploy
artifice only in the feeblest sense of the word, breaking linguistic, sexual or
cognitive acts down into their simplest elements and digitizing them so that
they can be resynthesized according to models. They can generate all the
possibilities of a program or of a potential object. But artifice is in no way
concerned with what generates, merely with what alters, reality. Artifice is the
power of illusion. These machines have the artlessness of pure calculation, and
the games they offer are based solely on commutations and combinations. In
this sense they may be said to be virtuous, as well as virtual: they can never
succumb to their own object; they are immune even to the seduction of their
own knowledge. Their virtue resides in their transparency, their functionality,
their absence of passion and artifice. Artificial Intelligence is a celibate
machine.

What must always distinguish the way humans function from the way
machines function, even the most intelligent of machines, is the intoxication,
the sheer pleasure, that humans get from functioning. The invention of a
machine that can feel pleasure is something - happily - that is still beyond
human capacity. All kinds of spare parts are available to humans to help them
achieve gratification, but none has yet been devised that could take pleasure in
their stead. There are prostheses that can work better than humans, 'think' or
move around better than humans (or in place of humans), but there is no such
thing, from the point of view of technology or in terms of the media, as a
replacement for human pleasure, or for the pleasure of being human. For that
to exist, machines would have to have an idea of man, have to be able to invent
man - but inasmuch as man has already invented them, it is too late for that.
That is why man can always be more than he is, whereas machines can never
be more than they are . Even the most intelligent among machines are just what
they are - except, perhaps, when accidents or failures occur, events which
might conceivably be attributed to some obscure desire on the part of the
machine . Nor do machines manifest that ironical surplus or excess functioning
which contributes the pleasure, or suffering, thanks to which human beings
transcend their determinations - and thus come closer to their raison d'etre. Alas
for the machine, it can never transcend its own operation - which, perhaps,
explains the profound melancholy of the computer. All machines are celibate.
(All the same, the recent epidemic of computer viruses does embody a
striking anomaly: it is almost as though machines were able to obtain a sly
pleasure by producing perverse effects. This is an ironic and fascinating turn of
events. Could it be that artificial intelligence, by manifesting this viral patho­
logy, is engaging in self-parody - and thus acceding to some sort of genuine
intelligence?)
The celibacy of the machine entails the celibacy of Telecomputer Man. Thanks
to his computer or word processor, Telecomputer Man offers himself the

spectacle of his own brain, his own intelligence, at work. Similarly, through his
chat line or his Minitel, he can offer himself the spectacle of his own phanta­
sies, of a strictly virtual pleasure. He exorcizes both intelligence and pleasure at
the interface with the machine. The Other, the interlocutor, is never really
involved: the screen works much like a mirror, for the screen itself as locus of
the interface is the prime concern. An interactive screen transforms the process
of relating into a process of commutation between One and the Same. The
secret of the interface is that the Other here is virtually the Same: otherness is
surreptitiously conjured away by the machine. The most probable scenario of
communication here is that Minitel users gravitate from the screen to tele­
phone conversations, thence to face-to-face meetings, and . . . then what?
Well, it's 'let's phone each other', and, finally, back to the Minitel - which is,
after all, more erotic because it is at once both esoteric and transparent. This is
communication in its purest form, for there is no intimacy here except with the
screen, and with an electronic text that is no more than a design filigreed onto
life. A new Plato' s retreat whence to observe shadow-forms of bodily pleasure
filing past. Why speak to one another, when it is so simple to communicate?
We lived once in a world where the realm of the imaginary was governed by
the mirror, by dividing one into two, by theatre, by otherness and alienation.
Today that realm is the realm of the screen, of interfaces and duplication, of
contiguity and networks . All our machines are screens, and the interactivity of
humans has been replaced by the interactivity of screens. Nothing inscribed on
these screens is ever intended to be deciphered in any depth: rather, it is
supposed to be explored instantaneously, in an abreaction immediate to
meaning, a short-circuiting of the poles of representation.
Reading a screenful of information is quite a different thing from looking. It is a
digital form of exploration in which the eye moves along an endless broken

line. The relationship to the interlocutor in communication, like the relation­
ship to knowledge in data-handling, is similar: tactile and exploratory. A
computer-generated voice, even a voice over the telephone, is a tactile voice,
neutral and functional. It is no longer in fact exactly a voice, any more than
looking at a screen is exactly looking. The whole paradigm of the sensory has
changed. The tactility here is not the organic sense of touch: it implies merely
an epidermal contiguity of eye and image, the collapse of the aesthetic distance
involved in looking. We draw ever closer to the surface of the screen; our gaze
is, as it were, strewn across the image. We no longer have the spectator's
distance from the stage - all theatrical conventions are gone. That we fall so
easily into the screen's coma of the imagination is due to the fact that the screen
presents a perpetual void that we are invited to fill. Proxemics of images:
promiscuity of images: tactile pornography of images. Yet the image is always
light years away. It is invariably a tele-image - an image located at a very
special kind of distance which can only be described as unbridgeable by the body.
The body can cross the distance that separates it from language, from the stage,
or from the mirror - this is what keeps it human and allows it to partake in
exchange. But the screen is merely virtual - and hence unbridgeable. This is
why it partakes only of that abstract - definitively abstract - form known as
communication.
Within the space of communication, words, gestures, looks are in a continual
state of contiguity, yet they never touch. The fact is that distance and proximity
here are simply not relationships obtaining between the body and its sur­
roundings. The screen of our images, the interactive screen, the telecomputing
screen, are at once too close and too far away: too close to be true (to have the
dramatic intensity of a stage) - and too far away to be false (to embody the
collusive distance of artifice) . They thus create a dimension that is no longer
quite human, an excentric dimension corresponding to the depolarization of
space and the indistinctness of bodily forms of expression.

There is no better model of the way in which the computer screen and the
mental screen of our own brain are interwoven than Moebius's topology, with
its peculiar contiguity of near and far, inside and outside, object and subject
within the same spiral. It is in accordance with this same model that informa­
tion and communication are constantly turning round upon themselves in an
incestuous circumvolution, a superficial conflation of subject and object,
within and without, question and answer, event and image, and so on. The
form is inevitably that of a twisted ring reminiscent of the mathematical symbol
for infinity.
The same may be said of our relationship with our 'virtual' machines.
Telecomputer Man is assigned to an apparatus, just as the apparatus is
assigned to him, by virtue of an involution of each into the other, a refraction of
each by the other. The machine does what the human wants it to do, but by the
same token the human puts into execution only what the machine has been
programmed to do. The operator is working with virtuality: only apparently is
the aim to obtain information or to communicate; the real purpose is to explore
all the possibilities of a program, rather as a gambler seeks to exhaust the
permutations in a game of chance. Consider the way the camera is used now.
'
Its possibilities are no longer those of a subject who 'reflects' the world
according to his personal vision; rather, they are the possibilities of the lens, as
exploited by the object. The camera is thus a machine that vitiates all will,
erases all intentionality and leaves nothing but the pure reflex needed to take
pictures. Looking itself disappears without trace, replaced by a lens now in
collusion with the object - and hence with an inversion of vision. The magic
lies precisely in the subject's retroversion to a camera obscura - the reduction
of his vision to the impersonal vision of a mechanical device. In a mirror, it is
the subj ect who gives free rein to the realm of the imaginary. In the camera
lens, and on-screen in general, it is the object, potentially, that unburdens itself
- to the benefit of all media and telecommunications techniques.

This is why images of anything are now a possibility. This is why everything
is translatable into computer terms, commutable into digital form, just as each
individual is commutable into his own particular genetic code. (The whole
object, in fact, is to exhaust all the virtualities of such analogues of the genetic
code: this is one of artificial intelligence's most fundamental aspects.) What
this means on a more concrete level is that there is no longer any such thing as
an act or event which is not refracted into a technical image or onto a screen,
any such thing as an action which does not in some sense wan t to be
photographed, filmed or tape-recorded, does not desire to be stored in
memory so as to become reproducible for all eternity. No such thing as an
action which does not aspire to self-transcendence into a virtual eternity - not,
now, the durable eternity that follows death, but rather the ephemeral eternity
of ever-ramifying artificial memory.
The compulsion of the virtual is the compulsion to exist in potentia on all
screens, to be embedded in all programs, and it acquires a magical force: the
Siren call of the black box.
Where is the freedom in all this? Nowhere! There is no choice here, no final
decision. All decisions concerning networks, screens, information or commu­
nication are serial in character, partial, fragmentary, fractal. A mere succession
of partial decisions, a microscopic series of partial sequences and objectives,
constitute as much the photographer's way of proceeding as that of Telecom­
puter Man in general, or even that called for by our own most trivial television
viewing. All such behaviour is structured in quantum fashion, composed of
haphazard sequences of discrete decisions. The fascination derives from the
pull of the black box, the appeal of an uncertainty which puts paid to our
freedom.
Am I a man or a machine? This anthropological question no longer has an
answer. We are thus in some sense witness to the end of anthropology, now

being conjured away by the most recent machines and technologies. The
uncertainty here is born of the perfecting of machine networks, just as sexual
uncertainty (Am I a man or a woman? What has the difference between the
sexes become?) is born of increasingly sophisticated manipulation of the
unconscious and of the body, and just as science's uncertainty about the status
of its object is born of the sophistication of analysis in the microsciences.
Am I a man or a machine? There is no ambiguity in the traditional
relationship between man and machine : the worker is always, in a way, a
stranger to the machine he operates, and alienated by it. But at least he retains
the precious status of alienated man. The new technologies, with their new
machines, new images and interactive screens, do not alienate me. Rather, they
form an integrated circuit with me. Video screens, televisions, computers and
Minitels resemble nothing so much as contact lenses in that they are so many
transparent prostheses, integrated into the body to the point of being almost
part of its genetic make-up: they are like pacemakers - or like Philip K. Dick's
'papula', a tiny implant, grafted onto the body at birth as a 'free gift', which
serves the organism as an alarm signal. All our relationships with networks
and screens, whether willed or not, are of this order. Their structure is one of
subordination, not of alienation - the structure of the integrated circuit. Man or
machine? Impossible to tell.
Surely the extraordinary success of artificial intelligence is attributable to
the fact that it frees us from real intelligence, that by hypertrophying thought
as an operational process it frees us from thought's ambiguity and from the
insoluble puzzle of its relationship to the world. Surely the success of all these
technologies is a result of the way in which they make it impossible even to
raise the timeless question of liberty. What a relief! Thanks to the machinery of
the virtual, all your problems are over! You are no longer either subject or
object, no longer either free or alienated - and no longer either one or the other:
you are the same, and enraptured by the commutations of that sameness. We
have left the hell of other people for the ecstasy of the same, the purgatory of

otherness for the artificial paradises of identity. Some might call this an even
worse servitude, but Telecomputer Man, having no will of his own, knows
nothing of serfdom. Alienation of man by man is a thing of the past: now man
is plunged into homeostasis by machines.

59

PROPHYLAXIS AND
VIRULENCE

The growing cerebrality of machines must logically be expected to occasion a
technological purification of bodies. Inasmuch as bodies are less and less able
to count on their own antibodies, they are more and more in need of protection
from outside. An artificial sterilization of all environments must compensate
for faltering internal immunological defences. And if these are indeed faltering,
it is because the irreversible process often referred to as progress tends to strip
the human body and mind of their systems of initiative and defence, reassign­
ing these functions to technical artifacts. Once dispossessed of their defences,
human beings become eminently vulnerable to science and technology; dis­
possessed of their passions, they likewise become eminently vulnerable to
psychology and its attendant therapies; similarly, too, once relieved of emo­
tions and illnesses, they become eminently vulnerable to medicine.
Consider the 'Boy in the Bubble', surrounded, in his NASA-donated tent,
by an atmospheric distillate of medical knowledge, protected from any con­
ceivable infection by an artificial immune system, 'cuddled' by his mother
through the glass, laughing and growing up in an extraterrestrial ambiance

under the vigilant eye of science. Here we have the experimental version of the
wolf-child, the 'wild child' raised by wolves. The parenting in this case,
however, is done by computers.
The Boy in the Bubble is a prefigurement of the future - of that total
asepsis, that total extirpation of germs, which is the biological form of transpar­
ency. He epitomizes the kind of vacuum-sealed existence hitherto reserved for
bacteria and particles in laboratories but now destined for us as, more and
more, we are vacuum-pressed like records, vacuum-packed like deep-frozen
foods and vacuum-enclosed for death as victims of fanatical therapeutic
measures. That we think and reflect in a vacuum is demonstrated by the
ubiquitousness of artificial intelligence.
It is not absurd to suppose that the extermination of man begins with the
extermination of man's germs. One has only to consider the human being
himself, complete with his emotions, his passions, his laughter, his sex and his
secretions, to conclude that man is nothing but a dirty little germ - an irrational
virus marring a universe of transparency. Once he has been purged, once
everything has been cleaned up and all infection - whether of a social or a
bacillary kind - has been driven out, then only the virus of sadness will remain
in a mortally clean and mortally sophisticated world.
Thought, itself a sort of network of antibodies and natural immune
defences, is also highly vulnerable. It is in acute danger of being conveniently
replaced by an electronic cerebrospinal bubble from which any animal or
metaphysical reflex has been expunged. Even without all the technological
advantages of the Boy in the Bubble, we are already living in the bubble
ourselves - already, like those characters in Bosch paintings, enclosed in a
crystal sphere: a transparent envelope in which we have taken refuge and
where we remain, bereft of everything yet overprotected, doomed to artificial
immunity, continual transfusions and, at the slightest contact with the world
outside, instant death.

This is why we are all losing our defences - why we are all potentially
immunodeficient.
All integrated and hyperintegrated systems - the technological system, the
social system, even thought itself in artificial intelligence and its derivatives tend towards the extreme constituted by immunodeficiency. Seeking to elimi­
nate all external aggression, they secrete their own internal virulence, their
own malignant reversibility. When a certain saturation point is reached, such
systems effect this reversal and undergo this alteration willy-nilly - and thus
tend to self-destruct. Their very transparency becomes a threat to them, and
the crystal has its revenge.
In a hyperprotected space the body loses all its defences. So sterile are
operating rooms that no germ or bacterium can survive there. Yet this is the
very place where mysterious, anomalous viral diseases make their appearance .
The fact is that viruses proliferate as soon as they find a free space. A world
purged of the old forms of infection, a world 'ideal' from the clinical point of
view, offers a perfect field of operations for the impalpable and implacable
pathology which arises from the sterilization itself.
This is a third-level pathology. Just as our societies are confronting a new
kind of violence, born of the paradoxical fact that they are simultaneously both
permissive and pacified, so too we face new illnesses, those illnesses which
beset bodies overprotected by their artificial, medical or computer-generated
shield. This pathology is produced not by accident, nor by anomie, but rather
by anomaly. The very same thing happens with the social body, where the same
causes bring about the same perverse effects, the same unforeseeable dysfunc­
tions - a situation comparable to the genetic disorder that occurs at the cellular
level, again occasioned by overprotection, overcoding, overmanagement. The
social system, just like the biological body, loses its natural defences in precise
proportion to the growing sophistication of its prostheses. Moreover, this
unprecedented pathology is unlikely to be effectively conjured away by
medicine, because medicine is itself part of the system of overprotection, and

contributes to the fanatical protective and preventive measures lavished upon
the body. Just as there seems to be no political solution to the problem of
terrorism, so there seems to be no biological solution at present to the problems
of AIDS and cancer. Indeed, the causes are identical: anomalous symptoms
generated at the most fundamental level by the system itself represent a
reactive virulence designed to counter, in the first case, a political overmanage­
ment of the social body, and in the second case, a biological overmanagement
of the body tou t court.
At an early stage the evil genie of otherness takes the forms of accident,
breakdown, failure. Only later does the viral, epidemic form make its appear­
ance: a virulence that ravages the entire system, and against which the system
is defenceless precisely because its very integrity paradoxically engenders this
alteration.
Virulence takes hold of a body, a network or other system when that system
rejects all its negative components and resolves itself into a combinatorial
system of simple elements. It is because a circuit or a network has thus become
a virtual being, a non-body, that viruses can run riot within it; hence too the
much greater vulnerability of 'immaterial' machines as compared with traditio­
nal mechanical devices. Virtual and viral go hand in hand. It is because the
body itself has become a non-body, a virtual machine, that viruses are taking it
over.
It is logical that AIDS (and cancer) should have become the prototypes of
our modern pathology, as of all lethal viral onslaughts. Saddling the body with
replacement parts and abandoning it to genetic whims inevitably dislocates its
systems of defence . A fractal body whose external functions are fated to
multiply is, by the same token, fated to suffer internal proliferation at the
cellular level. Metastasis occurs - and internal and biological metastases are
paralleled by the external metastases constituted by prostheses, networks and
ramiform systems.

Under the reign of the virus you are destroyed by your own antibodies.
This is the leukaemia of an organism devouring its own defences, precisely
because all threat, all adversity, has disappeared. Total prophylaxis is lethal.
This is what medicine has failed to grasp: it treats cancer or AIDS as if they
were conventional illnesses, when in fact they are illnesses generated by the
very success of prophylaxis and medicine, illnesses bred of the disappearance
of illnesses, of the elimination of pathogenic forms. We are confronted by a
third-level pathology, one that is inaccessible to the pharmacopoeia of an
earlier period (characterized by visible causes and mechanically produced
effects) . Suddenly all afflictions seem to originate in immunodeficiency rather as all violence now seems to have its roots in terrorism. The onslaught of
viruses and their strategies have in a sense taken over the work of the
unconscious.
Just as human beings, conceived of as digital machines, have become the
preferred field of operations of viral illnesses, so have software networks
become the preferred field of operations of electronic viruses. Here too there is
no effective prevention or cure: metastasis affects entire networks, and desym­
bolized machine languages offer no more resistance to viral infection than do
desymbolized bodies. The familiar breakdowns and mechanical accidents of
earlier times responded to good old-fashioned reparative medicine, but for
these sudden weakenings, sudden anomalies, sudden 'stabs in the back' by
antibodies, we have no remedy. We knew how to cure illnesses of forms;
against pathologies of formulas we are without defences. Having everywhere
sacrificed the natural balance of forms in favour of an artificial concordance
between code and formula, we have unleashed the threat of a far graver
disorder, of a destabilization without precedent. Having turned the body and
language into artificial systems in thrall to artificial intelligence, we have
abandoned them not only to artificial stupidity but also to all the viral
aberrations generated by this irreversible artificiality.

Viral attack is the pathology of the closed circuit, of the integrated circuit, of
promiscuity and of the chain reaction - in a broad and metaphorical sense, a
pathology of incest. He who lives by the same shall die by the same. The
absence of otherness secretes another, intangible otherness: the absolute other
of the virus.
That AIDS should have struck homosexuals and drug-users first is a
reflection of the incestuousness of groups which function as closed circuits.
We had known for a long time that haemophilia was linked to consanguine
marriages and predominantly endogamous social systems. Even the strange
sickness that affected cypress trees for so long turned out to be a sort of virus
attributable to a lessening of the temperature difference between winter and
summer - to a promiscuity, so to speak, of the seasons. The spectre of the Same
had struck again. In every compulsion to resemblance, every extradition of
difference, in all contiguity of things and their own image, all conflation of
beings and their own code, lies the threat of an incestuous virulence, a
diabolical otherness boding the breakdown of all this humming machinery.
This is the reappearance of the principle of Evil in a new guise. No morality or
guilt is implied, however: the principle of Evil is simply synonymous with the
principle of reversal, with the turns of fate. In systems undergoing total
positivization - and hence desymbolization - evil is equivalent, in all its forms,
to the fundamental rule of reversibility.
Still, there is an ambiguity in this very virulence. AIDS serves to justify a new
prohibition on sex - no longer a moral prohibition but a functional one, one
directed not at sex per se but merely at its unhindered circulation. The current is
to be interrupted, the flow stopped. But this runs counter to all the command­
ments of modernity, according to which sex, money and information must
circulate freely. Everything is supposed to be fluid, everything should acceler­
ate inexorably. The placing of strictures upon sexuality on grounds of viral risk
seems as absurd as halting foreign-exchange dealings because they foster

speculation or wild fluctuations in the value of the dollar. Unthinkable! And
yet, all of a sudden, there it is: no more sex. Is there a contradiction in the
system here?
Could it be that this suspension has a paradoxical aim, one bound up with
the equally paradoxical aim of sexual liberation? We are acquainted with that
spontaneous self-regulation of systems whereby they themselves produce
accidents or slowdowns in order to survive. No society can live without in a
sense opposing its own value system: it has to have such a system, yet it must
at the same time define itself in contradistinction to it. At present we live
according to at least two principles: that of sexual liberation and that of
communication and information. And everything suggests that the species
itself, via the threat of AIDS, is generating an antidote to its principle of sexual
liberation; that by means of cancer, which is a breakdown of the genetic code, it
is setting up a resistance to the all-powerful principle of cybernetic control; and
that the viral onslaught in general signals its sabotaging of the universal
principle of communication.
What if all this betokened a refusal of the obligatory flows of sperm, sex and
words, a refusal of forced communication, programmed information and
sexual promiscuity? What if it heralded a vital resistance to the spread of flows,
circuits and networks - at the cost, it is true, of a new and lethal pathology, but
one, nevertheless, that would protect us from something even worse? If so,
then AIDS and cancer would be the price we are paying for our own system: an
attempt to cure its banal virulence by recourse to a fatal form. Nobody can
predict the effectiveness of such an exorcism, but the question has to be asked:
What is cancer a resistance to, what even worse eventuality is it saving us
from? (Could it be the total hegemony of genetic coding?) What is AIDS a
resistance to, what even worse eventuality is it saving us from? (Could it be a
sexual epidemic, a sort of total promiscuity?) The same goes for drugs: all
melodramatics aside, what exactly do they protect us from, from what even
worse scourge do they offer us an avenue of escape? (Could it be the

brutalizing effects of rationality, normative socialization and universal condi­
tioning?) As for terrorism, does not its secondary, reactive violence shield us
from an epidemic of consensus, from an ever-increasing political leukaemia
and degeneration and from the imperceptible transparency of the State? All
things are ambiguous and reversible . After all, it is neurosis that offers human
beings their most effective protection against madness. AIDS may thus be seen
not as a divine punishment, but as quite the opposite - as a defensive
abreaction on the part of the species against the danger of a total promiscuity, a
total loss of identity through the proliferation and speed-up of networks.
The high degree to which AIDS, terrorism, crack cocaine or computer viruses
mobilize the popular imagination should tell us that they are more than
anecdotal occurrences in an irrational world. The fact is that they contain
within them the whole logic of our system: these events are merely the
spectacular expression of that system. They all hew to the same agenda of
virulence and radiation, an agenda whose very power over the imagination is
of a viral character: a single terrorist act obliges a reconsideration of politics as a
whole in the light of terrorism's claims; an outbreak of AIDS, even a statistically
insignificant one, forces us to view the whole spectrum of disease in the light of
the immunodeficiency thesis; and the mildest of computer viruses, whether it
vitiates the Pentagon's memory banks or merely erases a shower of on-line
Christmas messages, has the potential to destabilize all data contained in
information systems.
Whence the special status of such extreme phenomena - and of cata­
strophe in general, understood as an anomalous turn of events. The secret
order of catastrophe resides in the affinity between all these processes, as in
their homology with the system as a whole . Order within disorder: all extreme
phenomena are consistent both with respect to each other and with respect to
the whole that they constitute. This means that it is useless to appeal to some
supposed rationality of the system against that system's outgrowths. The

vanity of seeking to abolish these extreme phenomena is absolute. Moreover,
they are destined to become more extreme still as our systems grow more
sophisticated. And this is in fact a good thing - for they are the leading edge of
therapy here. In these transparent, homeostatic or homeofluid systems there is
no longer any such thing as a strategy of Good against Evil, there is only the
pitting of Evil against Evil - a strategy of last resort. Indeed, we really have no
choice in the matter: we simply watch as the lesser evil - homeopathic
virulence - deploys its forces. AIDS, crack and computer viruses are merely
outcrop pings of the catastrophe; nine-tenths of it remain buried in the virtual.
The full-blown, the absolute catastrophe would be a true omnipresence of all
networks, a total transparency of all data - something from which, for now,
computer viruses preserve us. Thanks to them, we shall not be going straight
to the culminating point of the development of information and communica­
tions, which is to say: death. These viruses are both the first sign of this lethal
transparency and its alarm signal. One is put in mind of a fluid travelling at
increasing speed, forming eddies and anomalous countercurrents which arrest
or dissipate its flow. Chaos imposes a limit upon what would otherwise hurtle
into an absolute void . The secret disorder of extreme phenomena, then, plays a
prophylactic role by opposing its chaos to any escalation of order and transpar­
ency to their extremes. But these phenomena notwithstanding, we are already
witness to the beginning of the end of a certain way of thinking. Similarly, in
the case of sexual liberation, we are already witness to the beginning of the end
of a certain type of gratification. If total sexual promiscuity were ever achieved,
however, sex itself would self-destruct in the resulting asexual flood. Much the
same may be said of economic exchange. Financial speculation, as turbulence,
makes the boundless extension of real transactions impossible. By precipitat­
ing an instantaneous circulation of value - by, as it were, electrocuting the
economic model - it also short-circuits the catastrophe of a free and universal
commutability - such a total liberation being the true catastrophic tendency of
value.

In the face of the threats of a total weightlessness, an unbearable lightness
of being, a universal promiscuity and a linearity of processes liable to plunge us
into the void, the sudden whirlpools that we dub catastrophes are really the
thing that saves us from catastrophe. Anomalies and aberrations of this kind
re-create zones of gravity and density that counter dispersion. It may be
hazarded that this is how our societies secrete their own peculiar version of an
accursed share, much after the fashion of those tribal peoples who used to
dispose of their surplus population by means of an oceanic suicide: the
homeopathic suicide of a few serving to maintain the homeostatic balance of
the group.
So the actual catastrophe may turn out to be a carefully modulated strategy
of our species - or, more precisely, our viruses, our extreme phenomena, which
are most definitively real, albeit localized, may be what allow us to preserve the
energy of that virtual catastrophe which is the motor of all our processes,
whether economic or political, artistic or historical.
To epidemic, contagion, chain reactions and proliferation we owe at once the
worst and the best. The worst is metastasis in cancer, fanaticism in politics,
virulence in the biological sphere and rumour in the sphere of information.
Fundamentally, though, all these also partake of the best, for the process of
chain reaction is an immoral process, beyond good and evil, and hence
reversible. It must be said, moreover, that we greet both worst and best with
the same fascination.
That it should be possible for certain processes - economic, political,
linguistic, cultural, sexual, even theoretical and scientific - to set aside the
limitations of meaning and proceed by immediate contagion, according to the
laws of the pure reciprocal immanencies of things among themselves rather
than the laws of their transcendence or their referentiality - that this is possible
poses an enigma to reason while offering a marvellous alternative to the
imagination.

One has but to consider the phenomenon of fashion, which has never been
satisfactorily explained. Fashion is the despair of sociology and aesthetics: a
prodigious contagion of forms in which chain reactions struggle for supremacy
over the logic of distinctions. The pleasure of fashion is undeniably cultural in
origin, but does it not stem even more clearly from a flaring, unmediated
consensus generated by the interplay of signs? Moreover, fashions fade away
like epidemics once they have ravaged the imagination, once the virus has run
its course. The price to be paid in terms of waste is always exorbitant, yet
everyone consents. The marvellous in our societies resides in this ultra-rapid
circulation of signs at a surface level (as opposed to the ultra-slow circulation of
meanings). We love being contaminated by this process, and not having to
think about it. This is a viral onslaught as noxious as the plague, yet no moral
sociology, no philosophical reason, will ever extirpate it. Fashion is an irre­
ducible phenomenon because it partakes of a crazy, viral, mediationless form
of communication which operates so fast for the sole reason that it never
passes via the mediation of meaning.
Anything that bypasses mediation is a source of pleasure. In seduction
there is a movement from the one to the other which does not pass via the
same. (In cloning, it is the opposite: the movement is from the same to the same
without passage via the other; and cloning holds great fascination for us.) In
metamorphosis, the shift is from one form to another without passing via
meaning. In poetry, from one sign to another without passing via the refer­
ence . The collapsing of distances, of intervening spaces, always produces a
kind of intoxication. What does speed itself mean to us if not the fact of going
from one place to another without traversing time, from one moment to
another without passing via duration and movement? Speed is marvellous:
time alone is wearisome.

DRIVES AND
REPULSIONS

The homogenization o f circuits in a n ideal universe of synthesis and pros­
thesis, a universe which is positive, consensual and synchronous - all this
makes for a world that is unacceptable. Not only does the body rebel against
grafts or artificial replacement parts, but the mind too rises up against the
synergy imposed upon it by producing countless forms of allergy. Abreaction,
rejection and allergy are manifestations of a singular kind of energy, a visceral
energy which has replaced negativity and critical revolt and bred our time's
most emblematic phenomena: viral pathologies, terrorism, drugs, delinquency
- even such reputedly positive features as the cult of performance and a mass
production hysteria, which have much more to do with the compulsion to get
rid of something than with the drive to create anything at all. Today we are
driven far less by drives proper than by considerations of expulsion and
repulsion. Natural disasters themselves suggest a kind of allergy - a rejection
by nature of the operational dominance of human agency. As negativity
agonizes, such events constitute an irreducible sign of violence, a precious and

supernatural sign of denial. Moreover, their virulence, by its contagiousness,
frequently precipitates social disorder.
The great drives or impulses, with their positive, elective and attractive
powers, are gone. We desire still, but in the feeblest way only; our tastes are
less and less highly determined. The constellations of taste and of desire, like
that of the will, have been blown apart - by what mechanism, we do not know.
By contrast, the constellations of unwillingness, of repulsion and disgust, are
more solid than ever. It seems that this has generated a new energy, a counter­
energy, a force that has taken the place of desire in us, a viral abreaction in
response to whatever has replaced the world, the body and sex for us. Today
only distaste is determined - tastes are determinate no longer. Only rejections
are violent - projects are violent no longer. Our actions, our undertakings, our
sicknesses have less and less in the way of 'objective' motives: they arise for the
most part from a concealed self-disgust, an unacknowledged empty legacy
which causes us to try to get rid of our energy by whatever means. A kind of
exorcism, then, rather than a will to action. Could this be the principle of Evil in
a new form, one not far removed from magic - whose epicentre, as we know,
is, precisely, exorcism?
In Simmel's words, 'Negation is the simplest thing imaginable. That is why the
broad masses, whose component elements cannot achieve agreement as to
goals, come together here.' It is useless to expect a positive opinion or a critical
will from the masses, for they have none: all they have is an undifferentiated
power, the power to reject. Their strength flows solely from what they are able
to expel, to negate - and that is, first and foremost, any project that goes
beyond them, any class or understanding that transcends them. There is
something here of a philosophy of cunning born of the most brutal experience
- the experience of animals, or of peasants: 'They won't put that over on us
again, we won't fall for their calls to sacrifice, or listen to their pie in the sky.'
Profound disgust for the political order - though one that may well coexist with

specific political opinions. Disgust for the pretension and transcendence of
power, for the inevitability and abomination of the political sphere. Where
once there were political passions, we now find only the violence peculiar to a
fundamental disgust with everything political.
Power itself is founded largely on disgust. The whole of advertising, the whole
of political discourse, is a public insult to the intelligence, to reason - but an
insult in which we collaborate, abjectly subscribing to a silent interaction. The
day of hidden persuasion is over: those who govern us now resort unapologe­
tically to arm-twisting pure and simple. The prototype here was a banker got
up like a vampire, saying, 'I am after you for your money' . A decade has
already gone by since this kind of obscenity was introduced, with the govern­
ment's blessing, into our social mores. At the time we thought the ad feeble
because of its aggressive vulgarity. In point of fact it was a prophetic commer­
cial, full of intimations of the future shape of social relationships, because it
operated, precisely, in terms of disgust, avidity and rape. The same goes for
pornographic and food advertising, which are also powered by shamelessness
and lust, by a strategic logic of violation and anxiety. Nowadays you can
seduce a woman with the words, 'I am interested in your cunt' . The same kind
of crassness has triumphed in the realm of art, whose mounds of trivia may be
reduced to a single pronouncement of the type, 'What we want from you is
stupidity and bad taste' . And the fact is that we do succumb to this mass
extortion, with its subtle infusion of guilt.
It is true in a sense that nothing really disgusts us any more. In our eclectic
culture, which embraces the debris of all others in a promiscuous confusion,
nothing is unacceptable. But for this very reason disgust is nevertheless on the
increase - the desire to spew out this promiscuity, this indifference to every­
thing no matter how bad, this viscous adherence of opposites. To the extent
that this happens, what is on the increase is disgust over the lack of disgust. An

allergic temptation to reject everything en bloc: to refuse all the gentle brain­
washing, the soft-sold overfeeding, the tolerance, the pressure to embrace
synergy and consensus.
All the talk of immunity, antibodies, grafting and rejection should not
surprise anyone. In periods of scarcity, absorption and assimilation are the
order of the day. In periods of abundance, rejection and expulsion are the chief
concerns. Today, generalized communication and surplus information threa­
ten to overwhelm all human defences. Symbolic space, the mental space of
judgement, has no protection whatsoever. Not only am I unable to decide
whether something is beautiful or not, original or not, but the biological
organism itself is at a loss to know what is good for it and what is not. In such
circumstances everything becomes a bad object, and the only primitive
defence is abreaction or rejection.
Laughter itself is more often than not a vital abreaction to the disgust we
feel for the monstrous mixing and promiscuity that confront us. But for all that
we may gag on the absence of differentiation, it still fascinates us. We love to
mix everything up, even if it simultaneously repels us. The reaction whereby
the organism seeks to preserve its symbolic integrity is a vital one, even if the
price paid is life itself (as in the rejection of a transplanted heart). Why would
bodies not resist the arbitrary swapping of organs and cells? Also: why do cells,
in cancer, refuse to carry out their assigned functions?

74

THE MIRROR OF
TERRORISM

And why does terrorism exist, if not as a violent form of abreaction in the social
realm?
The most striking thing about events such as those that took place at the
Heysel Stadium, Brussels, in 1985, is not their violence per se but the way in
which this violence was given worldwide currency by television, and in the
process turned into a travesty of itself.
'How is such barbarity possible in the late twentieth century?' This is a false
question. There is no atavistic resurgence of some archaic type of violence. The
violence of old was both more enthusiastic and more sacrificial than ours.
Today's violence, the violence produced by our hypermodernity, is terror. A
simulacrum of violence, emerging less from passion than from the screen: a
violence in the nature of the image . Violence exists potentially in the emptiness
of the screen, in the hole the screen opens in the mental universe. So true is this
that it is advisable not to be in a public place where television is operating,
considering the high probability that its very presence will precipitate a violent
event. The media are always on the scene in advance of terrorist violence. This

is what makes terrorism a peculiarly modern form - far more modern than the
'objective' causes to which we seek to attribute it: political, sociological or
psychological approaches are simply not capable of accounting for such
events.
Another remarkable aspect of a happening like this is that it is in some way
expected. We all collude in the anticipation of a fatal outcome, even if we are
emotionally affected or shaken when it occurs. The Brussels police have been
criticized for failing to avert the explosion of violence at the Heysel Stadium,
but what no police could ever guard against is the sort of fascination, of mass
appeal, exercised by the terrorist model.
Occurrences of this kind represent a sudden crystallization of latent
violence. They are not confrontations between hostile forces, not a clash
between antagonistic passions, but the product of listless and indifferent forces
(among them television's inert audience) . The violence of football hooligans is
an aggravated form of indifference, one which has such resonance only
because it is based on a lethal crystallization of this kind. Fundamentally, such
violence is not so much an event as the explosive form assumed by an absence
of events. Or rather, the implosive form: and what implodes here is the political
void (rather than the resentment of some particular group), the silence of
history which has been repressed at the level of individual psychology, and the
indifference and silence of everyone. We are dealing, therefore, not with
irrational episodes in the life of our society, but instead with something that is
completely in accord with that society's accelerating plunge into the void.
There is another logic at work here, too, the logic of attempted role
reversal: spectators (English fans, in this case) turn themselves into actors;
usurping the role of the protagonists (players), under the gaze of the media,
they invent their own spectacle (which - we may as well admit it - is somewhat
more fascinating than the official one) . Now is this not precisely what is
expected of the modern spectator? Is he not supposed to abandon his specta­
torish inertia and intervene in the spectacle himself? Surely this is the leitmotiv

of the entire culture of participation? Curiously, it is in events of this kind that
modern hypersociality of the participatory variety is actualized - its own best
efforts notwithstanding. Deplore it as one might, the fact is that two hundred
seats smashed up at a rock concert is a sign of success. Where exactly does
participation pass over into too much participation? The answer to this question
- never acknowledged in the discourse of participation - is that 'good'
participation ends where signs of participation begin. Of course, things do not
always work out that way.
The Romans were straightforward enough to mount spectacles of this
kind, complete with wild beasts and gladiators, in the full light of day. We can
put on such shows only in the wings, as it were - accidentally, or illegally, all
the while denouncing them on moral grounds. (Not that this prevents us from
disseminating them worldwide as fodder for TV audiences: the few minutes of
film from the Heysel Stadium were the most often broadcast images of the
year.) Even the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles were transformed into a
giant parade, a worldwide show which, just like the Berlin Games of 1936, took
place in an atmosphere of terrorism created by power's need to show off its
muscles: the worldwide spectacle of sport was thus turned into a Cold War
strategy - an utter corruption of the Olympic ideal. Once wrenched away from
its basic principle, sport can be pressed into the service of any end whatsoever:
as a parade of prestige or of violence, it slips (to use Roger Caillois's termino­
logy) from play founded on competition and representation to circus-like play,
play based on the pull of vertigo.
Nor is politics immune from this trend. Behind the tragedy at the Heysel
Stadium, in fact, lies a kind of state terrorism. This is not manifested solely in
carefully programmed actions (the CIA, Israel, Iran, etc.). For there is also a
wilful pursuit of draconian policies, policies of provocation with regard to a
country's own citizens, attempts to fill entire sectors of the population with
despair, to drive them to the brink of suicide: all of this is part and parcel of the
policies of a number of modern states. Mrs Thatcher successfully destroyed the

miners by means of just such a calculated bloody-mindedness: the strikers
ended up discrediting themselves in the eyes of society. She has a similar
strategy towards unemployed hooligans: it is as though she turns them into
commandos herself, then sends them abroad; she condemns them, of course,
but their brutality remains the very same brutality that she demonstrates in the
exercise of her power. Liquidation policies of this kind, more or less drastic in
their application, are the stock in trade, justified by the appeal to crisis, of all
modern states. They inevitably entail extreme measures of the sort mentioned,
which are merely the diverted effects of a terrorism to which the State is in no way
opposed.
As soon as it becomes impossible for states to attack and destroy one another,
they turn almost automatically against their own peoples, their own territories;
a sort of civil war or internecine conflict begins between the State and its
natural referent. Is it not in fact the fate of every sign, every signifying and
representative agency, to abolish its natural referent?
Certainly this is the inevitable outcome in the political realm, a fact of
which both represented and representatives are perfectly - albeit obscurely aware. We are all Machiavellians without knowing it, by virtue of our obscure
consciousness of the fact that representation is no more than a dialectical
fiction concealing a duel to the death between the two parties involved, and
that it mobilizes a will to power and a will to destroy the other which may end
up with the destruction of the self through voluntary servitude: all power is
composed of the Hegemony of the Prince and the Holocaust of the People.
Neither a represented people nor a legitimate sovereign is now the issue.
That political configuration has given way to a contest in which there is no
longer any question of a social contract: a transpolitical contest between an
agency orientated towards totalitarian self-reference on the one hand, and
sardonic or refractory, agnostic and infantile masses on the other (masses
which no longer speak, though they chat) . This is the hypochondriacal

condition of the body devouring its own organs. Powers - States - have set
about destroying their own cities, their own landscapes, their own substance
and, indeed, themselves with a fury that can be compared only to the fury they
once directed towards the destruction of their enemies.
In the absence of an original political strategy (which is indeed perhaps no
longer possible), and in view of the impossibility of a rational management of
the social realm, the State becomes desocialized . It no longer works on the basis
of political will, but instead on the basis of intimidation, dissuasion, si.mulation,
provocation or spectacular solicitation. It invents a politics of disaffection and
indifference. This is the transpolitical reality behind all official policies: a cynical
bias towards the elimination of the social. Soccer hooligans are merely the most
extreme manifestation of this transpolitical conjuncture: they carry participa­
tion to its tragic limit, while at the same time daring the State to respond with
violence, to liquidate them. In this respect they are no different from terrorists.
The reason why such tactics fascinate us, quite apart from moral consider­
ations, is that they constitute a paroxystically up-to-the-minute model, a
mirror-image of our own disappearance qua political society - a disappearance
that 'political' pseudo-events strive so desperately to camouflage.
Another recent episode forms a pendant to the events of the Heysel
Stadium: in September 1987, in Madrid, a Real Madrid-Naples European Cup
match took place at night in a completely empty stadium, without a single
spectator, as a consequence of disciplinary action taken by the International
Federation in response to the excesses of the Madrid supporters at an earlier
game. Thousands of fans besieged the stadium, but no one got in. The match
was relayed in its entirety via television.
A ban of this kind could never do away with the chauvinistic passions
surrounding soccer, but it does perfectly exemplify the terroristic hyperrealism
of our world, a world where a 'real' event occurs in a vacuum, stripped of its
context and visible only from afar, televisually. Here we have a sort of

surgically accurate prefigurement of the events of our future: events so
minimal that they might well not need take place at all - along with their
maximal enlargement on screens. No one will have directly experienced the
actual course of such happenings, but everyone will have received an image of
them. A pure event, in other words, devoid of any reference in nature, and
readily susceptible to replacement by synthetic images.
This phantom football match should obviously be seen in conjunction with
the Heysel Stadium game, when the real event, football, was once again
eclipsed - on this occasion by a much more dramatic form of violence. There is
always the danger that this kind of transition may occur, that spectators may
cease to be spectators and slip into the role of victims or murderers, that sport
may cease to be sport and be transformed into terrorism: that is why the public
must simply be eliminated, to ensure that the only event occurring is strictly
televisual in nature . Every real referent must disappear so that the event may
become acceptable on television's mental screen.
Political events themselves likewise unfold, in a sense, in an empty
stadium (the empty form of representation) whence any real public has been
expelled because of potentially too lively passions, and whence nothing
emerges now save a television retranscription (CRT images, statistics, poll
results . . . ). Politics still works, even captivates us, but subtly everything
begins to operate as though some International Political Federation had
suspended the public for an indeterminate period and expelled it from all
stadiums to ensure the objective conduct of the match. Such is our present
transpolitical arena: a transparent form of public space from which all the
actors have been withdrawn - and a pure form of the event from which all
passion has been removed.

WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO EVIL?

Terrorism in all its forms is the transpolitical mirror of evil. For the real
problem, the only problem, is: where did Evil go? And the answer is: every­
where - because the anamorphosis of modern forms of Evil knows no bounds .
I n a society which seeks - b y prophylactic measures, b y annihilating its own
natural referents, by whitewashing violence, by exterminating all germs and all
of the accursed share, by performing cosmetic surgery on the negative - to
concern itself solely with quantified management and with the discourse of the
Good, in a society where it is no longer possible to speak Evil, Evil has
metamorphosed into all the viral and terroristic forms that obsess us.
The force of anathema and the power of speaking Evil are no longer ours.
But they have resurfaced elsewhere - witness Ayatollah Khomeini in the
matter of Salman Rushdie. Quite apart from performing a tour de force whereby
the West has been obliged to hold this particular hostage itself, whereby
Rushdie has in a way been obliged to hold himself entirely hostage, the
Ayatollah has offered spectacular proof of how it is possible to overturn all
existing power relations through the symbolic force of an utterance.

Confronting the entire world, his tally utterly negative in the distribution
of political, military and economic forces, the Ayatollah had but one weapon at
his disposal, yet that weapon, though it had no material reality, came close to
being the absolute weapon: the principle of Evil. The negation of all Western
values - of progress, rationality, political ethics, democracy, and so on. By
rejecting- the universal consensus on all these Good Things, Khomeini became
the recipient of the energy of Evil, the Satanic energy of the rejected, the
glamour of the accursed share. He alone now holds the tribune because he
alone has upheld against all comers the Machiavellian principle of Evil,
because he alone is ready to speak Evil and exorcize Evil, because he alone
allows himself to incarnate that principle on the basis of terror. His motivations
are unintelligible to us. On the other hand, we cannot fail to recognize the
superiority that his posture assures him over a West where the possibility of
evoking Evil does not exist and every last trace of negativity is smothered by
the virtual consensus that prevails. Our political authorities themselves are but
mere shadows of their declared functions. For power exists solely by virtue of
its symbolic ability to designate the Other, the Enemy, what is at stake, what
threatens us, what is Evil. Today this ability has been lost, and, correspond­
ingly, there exists no opposition able or willing to designate power as Evil. We
have become very weak in terms of Satanic, ironic, polemical and antagonistic
energy; our societies have become fanatically soft - or softly fanatical. By
hunting down all of the accursed share in ourselves and allowing only positive
values free rein, we have made ourselves dramatically vulnerable to even the
mildest of viral attacks, including that of the Ayatollah - who, for one, is not
suffering from immunodeficiency. What is more, we end up treating
Khomeini, in the name of the rights of man, as 'Absolute Evil' (Mitterrand) - in
other words, we respond to his imprecation in its own terms, something which
runs counter to the rules of any enlightened discourse. (Do we now ever
describe a mad person as 'mad'? As a matter of fact, we are so terrified of Evil,

so greedy for euphemisms to denote the Other, misfortune, or other irreduc­
ibles, that we no longer even refer to a cripple as such.) Little wonder, then,
that someone capable of speaking the language of Evil literally, even trium­
phantly, should have precipitated such an attack of weak knees among
Western cultures (all the petitions of the intellectuals notwithstanding). The
fact is that legality, good conscience and even reason itself end up collaborat­
ing with the curse . They have no choice but to call down all the resources of
anathema, but by that very fact they fall into the trap of the principle of Evil,
which is contagious in its essence. So who won? The Ayatollah, unquestion­
ably. Of course we still have the power to destroy him, but on the symbolic
level he is the victor, and symbolic power is always superior to the power of
arms and money. This is, in a way, the revenge of the Other World. The Third
World has never been able to throw down a real challenge to the West. As for
the USSR, which for several decades incarnated Evil for the West, it is
obviously in the process of quietly lining up on the side of Good, on the side of
an extremely moderate way of managing things. (By a marvellous irony the
USSR has even put itself forward as mediator between the West and the Satan
of Teheran, having defended Western values for five years in Afghanistan
without anyone quite realizing it.)
The reactions of fascination, attraction and worldwide repulsion
unleashed by the Rushdie death sentence are reminiscent of the depressuriza­
tion of an aircraft cabin that occurs when the plane's fuselage is breached or
cracked . (Even when such an event is accidental, it resembles a terrorist act.)
Everything is sucked violently out into the void as a result of the variation in
pressure between inside and out. All that is needed is for a small rift or hole to
be made in the ultra-thin envelope that separates two worlds. Terrorism, the
taking of hostages, is par excellence an act that punches just such a hole in a
universe (ours) that is both artificial and artificially protected. Islam as a whole
- Islam as it is, not the Islam of the Middle Ages: the Islam that has to be
evaluated in strategic terms, not moral or religious ones - is in the process of

creating a vacuum around the Western system (including the countries of
Eastern Europe) and from time to time puncturing this system with a single act
or utterance, so that all our values are suddenly engulfed by the void. Islam
exerts no revolutionary pressure upon the Western universe, nor is there any
prospect of its converting or conquering the West: it is content to destabilize it
by means of viral attacks of this kind, in the name of a principle of Evil against
which we are defenceless and on the basis of the virtual catastrophe consti­
tuted by the difference in pressure between the two worlds, on the basis of the
perpetual threat to a protected universe (ours), of a brutal depressurization of
the atmosphere (the values) that we breathe. The fact is that a good deal of
oxygen has already escaped from our Western world through all kinds of
fissures and interstices. We would be well advised, therefore, to keep our
oxygen masks on.
The Ayatollah's strategy is a remarkably modern one, whatever people
might prefer to think. Far more modern than our own, in fact, because it
consists in subtly injecting archaic elements into a modern context: a fatwa, a
death sentence, an imprecation - no matter what. If only our Western universe
were solid, all this would be meaningless. In the event, however, our whole
system is swallowed up, and serves as a sound box - as a superconductor for
the virus. What does this mean? Here again we see the revenge of the Other
World: we have visited so many germs and sicknesses, so many epidemics and
ideologies, upon the rest of the world, which was utterly defenceless against
them, that our present defencelessness against a vile, archaic microorganism
seems to be a truly ironic twist of fate.
Even the hostages themselves become a seat of infection. In his recent book
Le Metier d'otage [Profession: Hostage], Alain Bosquet has shown how the
hostage, as a tiny portion of the Western world sucked out into the void,
cannot and does not ever want to return home; this is certainly in part
attributable to the victim's loss of self-esteem, but it is also because his own

people, his own country and his own fellow-citizens are diminished collecti­
vely by their forced passivity and their ordinary cowardice - and also by the act
of negotiating itself, which is both degrading per se and ultimately useless.
Beyond the question of negotiation, every hostage-taking bears witness to the
unavoidable spinelessness of entire societies with respect to even the most
insignificant of their members. This indifference on the part of the community
is echoed by each individual's indifference towards that community: this is
how we operate in the West - badly - and such is the political impoverishment
pitilessly illuminated by the strategy of taking hostages. The destabilization of
a single individual effectively destabilizes a whole system. This is why released
hostages can never forgive their compatriots for making heroes out of them.
(Such 'heroes' are, in any case, immediately hustled out of the public's view.)
We cannot read the Ayatollah's thoughts, nor can we see into the hearts of
Muslims. What we can do, however, is reject the feeble notion that everything
can be laid at the door of religious fanaticism. I very much fear, however, that
we are ill armed to counter the symbolic violence of the Ayatollah's challenge:
at this very moment we are striving to expunge the Terror from our memory of
the French Revolution, as we prepare to mount a commemoration which, like
the consensus, resembles nothing so much as an inflatable structure. How can
we ever confront this new violence if we prefer to eradicate even the violence
of our own history?
We can no longer speak Evil.
All we can do is discourse on the rights of man - a discourse which is pious,
weak, useless and hypocritical, its supposed value deriving from the Enlight­
enment belief in a natural attraction of the Good, from an idealized view of
human relationships (whereas Evil can manifestly be dealt with only by means
of Evil) .
What is more, even this Good qua ideal value is invariably deployed in a
self-defensive, austerity-loving, negative and reactive mode. All the talk is of

the minimizing of Evil, the prevention of violence: nothing but security. This is
the condescending and depressive power of good intentions, a power that can
dream of nothing except rectitude in the world, that refuses even to consider a
bending of Evil, or an intelligence of Evil.
There can be a 'right' to speech only if speech is defined as the 'free'
expression of an individual. Where speech is conceived of as a form implying
reciprocity, collusion, antagonism or seduction, the notion of right can have no
possible meaning.
Is there such a thing as a right to desire, a right to the unconscious, or a
right to pleasure? The idea is absurd. This is what makes the sexual liberation
movement ridiculous when it talks about rights, and what makes our 'com­
memoration' of the Revolution ridiculous when the rights of man are evoked.
The 'right to live' is an idea that sets all pious souls atremble, but when this
idea evolves into the right to die, the absurdity of the whole business becomes
obvious. For, after all, dying (and living too) is a destiny, a fate - be it happy or
unhappy - and certainly not a right.
Why not demand the 'right' to be a man or a woman? Or, for that matter, a
Leo, an Aquarius or a Cancer? But what would it mean to be a man or a woman
if it were a right? What makes life exciting is the fact that you have been placed
on one side or the other of the sexual divide, and you must take it from there.
Those are the rules of the game, and it makes no sense to break them. No one
can stop me from claiming the right to move my knight in a straight line on the
chessboard, but where does it get me? Rights in such matters are idiotic.
The right to work: yes, we have reached that point, thanks to a savage
irony. The right to unemployment! The right to strike! No one can even see the
surreal humour of such things any more. Occasionally, though, a certain black
humour does burst out here, as when an American condemned to death claims
the right to be executed despite the efforts of umpteen human-rights organiza­
tions to obtain a stay of execution. This is where things get interesting. The list
of rights turns out to include not a few bizarre varieties: the Israelis, for

example, claim as a sort of right the fact that there are criminals among their
number - whereas from time immemorial, Jews were only victims. Now at last
they can enj oy the officially endorsed luxury of criminality!
There can be no doubt either that the USSR, with Chernobyl, the Armenian
earthquake and the foundering of a nuclear submarine, has taken a giant step
towards an extension of the rights of man (indeed, beyond the accords of
Helsinki or elsewhere), for the Soviets have clearly laid claim to the right to
catastrophe. It is indeed your most fundamental and essential right - your right
to accidents, to crime, to error, to Evil, to the worst as well as to the best which, far more than your right to happiness, makes you a human being
worthy of the name .
In the sphere of rights the irresistible trend is towards a situation where, if
something can be taken for granted, all rights are otiose, whereas if a right must
be demanded, it means that the battle is already lost; thus the very call for
rights to water, air and space indicates that all these things are already on the
way out. Similarly the evocation of a right to reply signals the absence of any
dialogue, and so on.
The rights of the individual lose their meaning as soon as the individual is
no longer an alienated being, deprived of his own being, a stranger to himself,
as has long been the case in societies of exploitation and scarcity. In his
postmodern avatar, however, the individual is a self-referential and self­
operating unit. Under such circumstances the human-rights system becomes
totally inadequate and illusory: the flexible, mobile individual of variable
geometric form is no longer a subject with rights but has become, rather, a
tactician and promoter of his own existence whose point of reference is not
some agency of law but merely the efficiency of his own functioning or
performance.
Yet it is precisely now that the rights of man are acquiring a worldwide
resonance. They constitute the only ideology that is currently available - which
is as much as to say that human rights are the zero point of ideology, the sale

outstanding balance of history. Human rights and ecology are the two teats of
the consensus. The current world charter is that of the New Political Ecology.
Ought we to view this apotheosis of human rights as the irresistible rise of
stupidity, as a masterpiece which, though imperilled, is liable to light up the
coming fin de siecle in the full glare of the consensus?

NECROSPECTIVE

The vain quarrel over Heidegger has no philosophical significance of its own; it
is merely symptomatic of a weakness of present-day thought, which, being
unable to find any new impetus, returns obsessionally to its reference points;
and now, as the end of the century approaches, painfully relives its primal
scene, which dates from the century's early years. In a more general way the
fuss over Heidegger is symptomatic of the collective revival mania that has
overtaken our society as the time for passing the last hundred years in review
draws near: there is thus a revival of interest in fascism, in Nazism, in the
extermination; and here too there is a temptation to reopen the file on the
historical primal scene, to whitewash the dead, to put the balance straight. At
the same time, however, there is a perverse fascination with returning to the
source of the violence: a collective hallucinatory vision of the historical truth of
Evil. Our imaginative powers must indeed be in a feeble state at the moment,
our indifference towards our own situation and our own thinking must indeed
be immense, for us to be resorting to such regressive thaumaturgics.

Heidegger is accused of having been a Nazi. In point of fact it barely
matters whether the aim is to indict him or defend him on this charge; both
sides fall into the same trap, both sides are guilty of a low form of thought, a
thought so debilitated that it no longer has either confidence in its own
antecedents or the force to transcend them, while what little vision it retains is
squandered in impeachment, complaint, self-justification and historical verifi­
cation. Scrutinizing the ambiguities of its masters (even toppling them from
their pedestals as master-thinkers), philosophy is in a strictly defensive pos­
ture; the same goes for our society as a whole, which, having failed to generate
a new history, is doomed to chew over the old one in order to prove its own
existence - including the existence of its past crimes. But what does such a
proof amount to? It is really only because we have disappeared politically and
historically today (and therein lies our problem) that we seek to prove that we
died between 1940 and 1945, at Auschwitz or in Hiroshima - which at least
makes for a strong history. We are like the Armenians, who wear themselves
out trying to prove that they were massacred in 1917 - a proof that is
unattainable, useless, yet in some sense vital. It is because philosophy too has
disappeared today (and therein lies its problem, for how can something live if it
has disappeared?) that it seeks to demonstrate that it was definitively com­
promised along with Heidegger, or rendered aphasic by Auschwitz. All of this
reflects a desperate historical search for a posthumous truth, a posthumous
absolution - and it comes at a moment when there is, precisely, insufficient
truth available to ensure the verification of anything; when there is, precisely,
no longer enough philosophy to underpin any relationship between theory
and practice; and when there is, precisely, no longer enough history to back up
any historical proof of what happened.
We forget a little too easily that the whole of our reality is filtered through
the media, including tragic events of the past. This means that it is too late to
verify and understand those events historically, for the characteristic thing
about the present period, the present fin de siecle, is the fact that the tools

required for such intelligibility have been lost. History should have been
understood while history still existed. Heidegger should have been denounced
(or defended) while it was still possible to do so. A prosecution can be mounted
only if a sequential continuum exists between the supposed crime and the trial.
But we have now been transplanted elsewhere, and it is simply too late, as the
television programme Holocaust, and even the film Shoah, clearly demon­
strated. These things were not understood while we still had the means to
understand them. Now they never will be . They never will be because such
basic notions as responsibility, objective causes, or the meaning of history (or
lack thereof) have disappeared, or are in the process of disappearing. The
moral or social conscience is now a phenomenon entirely governed by the
media, and the therapeutic zeal applied to its resuscitation is itself an index of
how little wind it has left.
We shall never know now whether Nazism, the concentration camps or
Hiroshima were intelligible or not: we are no longer part of the same mental
universe. Victim and executioner are interchangeable, responsibility is dif­
frangible, dissoluble - such are the virtues of our marvellous interface . We no
longer have the strength that forgetting gives: our amnesia is an amnesia of the
image. Since everyone is guilty, who will declare an amnesty? As for autopsy,
no one believes any longer in the anatomical accuracy of the facts : we have
only models to work on. Even supposing the facts lay shining bright before our
eyes, they would still not have the power to prove or convince. Consider how
continual scrutiny of Nazism, of the gas chambers and so on, has merely
rendered them less and less comprehensible, so that it has eventually become
logical to ask an incredible question: 'But, in the last reckoning, did all those
things really exist?' The question is perhaps an intolerable one, but the
interesting thing here is what it is that makes it logically possible. And in fact
what makes it possible is the media's way of replacing any event, any idea, any
history, with any other, with the result that the more we scrutinize the facts,
the more carefully we study details with a view to identifying causes, the

greater is the tendency for them to cease to exist, and to cease to have existed.
Confusion over the identity of things is thus a function of our very attempts to
substantiate them, to fix them in memory. This indifference of memory, this
indifference to history, is proportional to our efforts to achieve historical
objectivity. One day we shall be asking ourselves whether Heidegger himself
ever existed. The paradox of Robert Faurisson's thesis may seem repugnant and indeed, it is repugnant in its historical claim that the gas chambers never
existed - but at the same time it is a perfect reflection of a whole culture: here is
the dead end of a fin de siecle so mesmerized by the horror of the century's
origins that forgetting is an impossibility for it, and the only way out is denial.
So proof is useless, since there is no longer any historical discourse in
which to frame the case for the prosecution, but punishment too is in any case
an impossibility. Auschwitz and the final solution simply cannot be expiated.
Punishment and crime have no common measure here, and the unrealistic
character of the punishment ensures the unreality of the facts. What we are
currently experiencing is something else entirely. What is actually occurring ­
collectively, confusedly, via all the trials and debates - is a transition from the
historical stage to a mythical stage: the mythic - and media-led - reconstruc­
tion of all these events. And in a sense this mythic conversion is the only
possible way, not to exculpate us morally, but to absolve us in phantasy from
the guilt of this primal crime. But in order for this to be achieved, in order for
even a crime to become a myth, the historical reality must first be eradicated.
Otherwise, since all these things (fascism, the camps, the extermination) have
been, and remain, historically unresolvable for us, we should be obliged to
repeat them for ever like a primal scene. It is not nostalgia for fascism that is
dangerous: what is dangerous - albeit pitiful - is that pathological re-enact­
ment of the past in which everyone plays a part, in which everyone effectively
collaborates - those who deny the existence of the gas chambers just as much
as those who believe in their reality, Heidegger's detractors just as much as his
defenders; what is dangerous is the mass delusion whereby all the wealth of

imagination missing from our time, all the capital of violence and reality, now
become illusory, is transplanted back to that time by a sort of compulsion to
relive it, by a sort of deep-seated guilt over not having been there. All this
bespeaks a desperate process of abreaction in response to the fact that these
events are on the point of escaping us on the level of reality. The Heidegger
affair, the Klaus Barbie trial, and so on, are just so many feeble convulsive
reactions to this loss of reality - which is now our reality. Faurisson's claims are
a cynical transposition of this loss of reality into the past. The statement 'It
never existed' means simply that we ourselves no longer exist sufficiently even
to sustain a memory, and that hallucinations are the only way we have left to
feel alive.
POSTSCRIPT
In view of this, perhaps we ought simply to dispense with our present fin de
siecle? I would suggest that the 1990s be abolished in advance, and that we go
directly from 1989 to 2000. After all, the fin de siecle has already arrived,
complete with its necro-cultural pathos, its endless commemorations and
mummifications. Is there any good reason why we should have to languish for
another decade in this hellish atmosphere?
RECTIFICATION: HIP, HIP, HOORAY!
HISTORY IS RISEN FROM THE DEAD!
The great event of the end of the century is under way! Everybody is suddenly
breathing free at the idea that History, momentarily smothered under the
weight of totalitarian ideology, has resumed its course with renewed vigour
following the lifting of the blockade around the countries of Eastern Europe .

The field of History has supposedly at last been reopened to the unpredictable
interplay of peoples and their thirst for freedom. In contrast to the depressive
mythology of past fins de siecie, the end of the twentieth century is now
supposed to inaugurate a dazzling remobilization of the final process, a rebirth
of hope and a return to play of all possibilities.
On closer inspection, however, the event in question turns out to be rather
more mysterious, rather more of an unidentified 'historical' object. The thaw­
ing out of the countries of the East is without doubt an extraordinary turn of
events . But what exactly happens to freedom when it is defrosted? Such an
operation must be a hazardous one, its outcome uncertain (quite apart from the
fact that you are not supposed to refreeze what you have once defrosted) . The
USSR and the Eastern bloc constituted not just a deep-freeze for freedom but
also a laboratory, an experimental environment in which freedom was isolated
and subjected to very high pressures. The West, on the other hand, is merely a
museum - or, more accurately, a dump - for freedom and the Rights of Man. If
deep-freezing was the distinctive (and negative) mark of the Eastern universe,
the ultra-fluidity of our Western universe is even more disreputable, because
thanks to the liberation and liberalization of our mores and beliefs, the problem
of freedom can simply no longer be posed. Rather, it is virtually resolved. In the
West, freedom - the Idea of freedom - has died its fine death; all the recent
commemorations have clearly shown that the idea of freedom is gone. In the
East it has been murdered - but there is no such thing as the perfect crime.
From an experimental standpoint it will be most interesting to see what
freedom is like when it resurfaces, resuscitated after being stripped of all its
signs. We should then get a sense of what such reanimation and postmortem
rehabilitation can do. Freedom defrosted may not, after all, be so fair to look
upon. And what if we find that it seeks nothing so much as to barter itself away
in a fervent embrace of automobiles and kitchen appliances, even of mind­
bending drugs and pornography: that is, to exchange itself immediately for
Western liquid assets; to pass from the end of history by means <;>f freezing to

the end of history by means of ultra-fluidity, by means of circulation? Because
the fascinating thing about the events in the East is certainly not that they may
be seen as placidly coming to the aid of ailing democracy and supplying it with
fresh energy (not to say fresh markets); what is far more fascinating is to
observe the telescoping of two specific scenarios of the end of History: the
scenario whereby it is frozen solid, as in the concentration camps, and the
scenario according to which it comes to an end thanks to a total centrifugal
expansion of communication. Both cases embody a final solution. And it is not
impossible that the thawing out of human rights in the East may be the socialist
equivalent to the 'depressurizing of the West' : a simple dissipation into the
Western void of the energies bottled up in the East for the last half-century.
The fervour accompanying these events may be deceptive. If it expresses
nothing more than the zeal with which the countries of the East are casting
aside the bonds of ideology, or if it is a mimetic fervour - a tribute, as it were, to
those liberal countries where all liberty has already been traded in for a
technically easy life - then we shall have found out definitively what freedom
is worth, and that it is probably never to be discovered a second time. History
offers no second helpings. On the other hand, it could be that the present thaw
in the East may be as disastrous in the long term as the excess of carbon dioxide
in the upper atmosphere, that it may bring about a political greenhouse effect,
and so overheat human relations on the planet that the melting of the
Communist ice-sheet will cause Western seaboards to be submerged. Odd that
we should be in such absolute fear of the melting of the polar ice, and look
upon it as a climatic catastrophe, while we aspire with every democratic bone
in our bodies to the occurrence of just such an event on the political plane.
If in the old days the USSR had released its gold reserves onto the world
market, that market would have been completely destabilized. Today, by
putting back into circulation their vast accumulated store of freedom, the
Eastern countries could quite easily destabilize that very fragile balance of
Western values which strives to ensure that freedom no longer emerges as

action but only as a virtual and consensual form of interaction; no longer as a
drama but merely as the universal psychodrama of liberalism. A sudden
infusion of freedom as a real currency, as violent and active transcendence, as
Idea, would be in every way catastrophic for our present air-conditioned
redistribution of values. Yet this is precisely what we are asking of the East:
freedom, the image of freedom, in exchange for the material signs of freedom.
This is an absolutely diabolical contract, by virtue of which one signatory is in
danger of losing their soul, and the other of losing their creature comforts. But
perhaps - who knows? - this may, after all, be the best thing for both sides.
Those societies that were formerly masked - Communist societies - have
been unmasked. What is their face like? As for us, we dropped the mask long
ago and have for a long time been without either mask or face. We are also
without memory. We have reached the point of searching the water for signs of
a memory that has left no traces, hoping against hope that something might
remain when even the water's molecular memory has faded away. So it goes
for our freedom: we would be hard put to it to produce a single sign of it, and
we have been reduced to postulating its infinitesimal, intangible, undetectable
existence in a (programmatic, operational) environment so highly dilute that in
truth only a spectre of freedom floats there still, in a memory every bit as
evanescent as water's.
The fountainhead of freedom in the West has run so dry (witness the
commemoration of the French Revolution) that we can but put all our hopes in
the East's reserves, as newly discovered and opened up. But once this store of
freedom has been liberated (the Idea of Liberty having indeed become as scarce
as a natural resource), what can be expected to happen except, as in any
marketplace, the release of an intense but superficial energy generated by
exchange, followed by a rapid collapse of differential energies and of prices?
What is the meaning of glasnost? A transparently clear reverse run through
all the signs of modernity, but in speeded-up motion and at second hand (a

postmodern remake, almost, of our original version of modernity); further­
more, positive and negative signs are mixed up together here, so that human
rights emerge side by side with crimes, catastrophes and accidents - all of
which have taken an enthusiastic statistical leap in the USSR since the regime
was liberalized . The country has even rediscovered pornography and extra­
terrestrials - hitherto censored, but now celebrating their reappearance along
with everything else . This is what lends the present global thaw its experimen­
tal aspect: we see that crimes and catastrophes, be they nuclear or natural everything, in fact, that has been repressed - are all part and parcel of human
rights (religion too, naturally, along with fashion in the broadest possible
sense) - and all this is a fine lesson in democracy. For everything that we are, all
the supposedly universal signs of the human, we now observe resurgent in the
East in the form of a kind of ideal hallucination, a kind of return of the
repressed embracing the worst, the most trivial and the most worn-out
features of Western 'culture' - which from now on knows no frontiers. The
present conjuncture is thus a moment of truth for this culture, as was its earlier
confrontation with the primitive cultures of the entire world (a confrontation
from which the West can scarcely be said to have emerged with flying colours) .
Such is the irony of fate that it is we who are going to be obliged perhaps one
day to save the historical memory of Stalinism, once the Eastern countries have
forgotten all about it. In that case it will be up to us to put the memory of the
dictator into cold storage, just as he once did to the movement of History itself;
after all, the Stalinist big freeze is also part of our universal heritage.
There is another sense, too, in which these events are extraordinary. Those
who adopt a self-righteous hostility to the idea of the end of History would do
well to consider the turn History is now taking - as witness these current
developments - not only towards its end (which remains part of the phantasy
of a linear history) but at the same time in the direction of its systematic
reversal and elimination. We are in the process of wiping out the whole of the

twentieth century. We are wiping out all signs of the Cold War one by one,
perhaps even all the signs of World War II and those of all the century's
political and ideological revolutions. The reunification of Germany and many
other things are inevitable, not in the sense of a leap forward of History but in
the sense of a reverse rewriting of the whole of the twentieth century - a
rewriting that will surely take up a very great deal of the century's last decade .
At our present rate, we should soon be back to the Holy Roman-Germanic
Empire. Here, perhaps, is the illumination we may expect for the present fin de
siecie, and the true meaning of the much-debated phrase 'the end of History' .
The fact is that we are busy, in accordance with an oddly enthusiastic
mourning process, smoothing out the salient events of the century, white­
washing the century, as though all that had occurred therein (revolutions,
partitions of the globe, extermination, the violent transnationalism of states, or
nuclear cliffhanging) - in short, History itself in its modern stage - amounted to
nothing but an imbroglio with no exit, and as though everyone had now begun
to unmake this history with an ardour equal in every way to that applied earlier
to its making. Restoration, regression, rehabilitation, the revival of old fron­
tiers, differences, specificities and religious beliefs - and everywhere, even on
the level of social mores, the change of heart: apparently all the marks of
liberation won over the last century are now fading, and perhaps they are all
destined to disappear altogether one after the other. We are in the midst of an
immense process of revisionism, but not in an ideological sense: History itself is
what we are revising, and we seem anxious to finish the job before the end of
the century. Do we perhaps nurture the secret hope that with the coming of the
new millennium we might be able to start all over again with a clean slate? That
somehow we can restore everything to its original state? But when exactly did
that state exist? Before the twentieth century? Before the French Revolution?
How far can this process of reabsorption and smoothing out take us? It can
certainly occur very, very quickly - witness the events in the East. This is
precisely because there is no construction involved, but rather a massive

deconstruction of History which has assumed almost viral and epidemic
proportions. Maybe after all the year 2000 will never occur, as I speculated long
ago, for the simple reason that the curve of History will have become so
accentuated as to create a reverse trajectory, with the result that that temporal
horizon will never be attained. History would in that case tum out to have been
an asymptote: an infinite curved line tending towards its own end, yet never
reaching that end, and at the last moment veering off from it in the opposite
direction.

THE FATE OF ENERGY

All

the events described here are susceptible to two kinds of diagnosis:
physical and metaphysical. From the physical point of view, we are apparently
dealing with a sort of massive phase transition in a human system in disequili­
brium. As with physical systems proper, this phase transition remains largely
mysterious for us, but the catastrophic development in question is in itself
neither beneficial nor malignant: it is simply catastrophic, in the literal sense of
the word.
The prototype of this chaotic declination, of this hypersensitivity to initial
conditions, is the fate of energy. Our culture has seen the development of the
liberation of energy as an irreversible process. All previous cultures have
depended on a reversible pact with the world, on a stable ordering of things in
which energy release certainly played a role, but never on the liberation of
energy as a basic principle. For us, energy is the first thing to be 'liberated', and
all subsequent forms of liberation are founded on this model. Man himself is
liberated as an energy source, so becoming the motor of a history and of a
speeding-up of that history.

Energy is a sort of phantasy projection which nourishes all modernity's
industrial and technical dreams; energy is also what tends to give our concep­
tion of man the sense of a dynamics of the will. We know, however, thanks to
the most recent findings of modem physics on the phenomena of turbulence,
chaos and catastrophe, that any flow - indeed, any linear process - when it is
speeded up is inflected in a curious way, a way that produces catastrophe.
The catastrophe that lies in wait for us is not connected to a depletion of
resources. Energy itself, in all its forms, will become more and more abundant
(at any rate, within the broadest time frame that could conceivably concern us
as humans) . Nuclear energy is inexhaustible, as are solar energy, the force of
the tides, of the great fluxes of nature, and indeed of natural catastrophes,
earthquakes and volcanoes (and technological imagination may be relied on to
find ways and means to harness them). What is alarming, by contrast, is the
dynamics of disequilibrium, the uncontrollability of the energy system itself,
which is capable of getting out of hand in deadly fashion in very short order.
We have already had a few spectacular demonstrations of the consequences of
the liberation of nuclear energy (Hiroshima, Chernobyl), but it must be
remembered that any chain reaction at all, viral or radioactive, has catastrophic
potential. Our degree of protection from pandemics is epitomized by the
utterly useless glacis that often surrounds nuclear power stations. It is not
impossible that the whole system of world-transformation through energy has
already entered a virulent and epidemic stage corresponding to the most
essential character of energy itself: a fall, a differential, an imbalance - a
catastrophe in miniature which to begin with has positive effects but which,
once overtaken by its own impetus, assumes the dimensions of a global
catastrophe.
Energy may be looked upon as a cause which produces effects, but it is also
an effect which is self-reproducing, and can thus cease to obey any law of
causality. The paradox of energy is that it implies a revolution on the level of
causes and a revolution on the level of effects - each, practically speaking,

independent of the other. It thus becomes the locus not only of a chain of
causes but also of an unhindered flood of effects.
Energy thus enters a state of superfusion. The whole system of world­
transformation enters a state of superfusion. Formerly a material and pro­
ductive variable, energy has now become a vertiginous process feeding upon
itself (which is, incidentally, why there is no danger that we shall run out of it).
Consider New York City. It is a miracle that everything starts afresh each
morning, considering how much energy has been used up the day before. The
phenomenon is indeed inexplicable until one realizes that no rational principle
of energy loss is at work here, and that the functioning of a megalopolis such as
New York contradicts the second law of thermodynamics: the city feeds on its
own hubbub, its own waste, its own carbon-dioxide emissions - energy arising
from the expenditure of energy, thanks to a sort of miracle of substitution.
Experts who base their calculations solely on the quantitative aspects of an
energy system inevitably underestimate the peculiar energy source contri­
buted by energy discharge itself. In the case of New York this discharge is
completely spectacularized - supercharged by its own image. In The Supermale,
Alfred Jarry describes a superfused energy of this order in connection with
sexual activity, but it may also occur in the cases of mental and mechanical
energy: as Jarry's quintuplette crosses Siberia in the wake of the Trans-Siberian,
some velocipedists die, yet carry on cycling. Rigor mortis is replaced by mobilitas
mortis, and the dead rider pedals on indefinitely, even accelerating, as a
function of inertia. The energy released is boosted by the inertia of the dead.
Here we are reminded of Mandeville's Fable of the Bees, according to which
the splendour of a society derives from its vices, its ills, its excesses and its
shortcomings . This thesis is diametrically opposed to the economists' claim
that if something is expended, it must obviously be produced. On the contrary,
the more we spend, the more energy and wealth increase. The energy in

question is, precisely, that of catastrophe - an energy that economic calcula­
tions can never take into account. A particular kind of exaltation familiar in
mental processes is now to be encountered in material processes as well. All
these considerations are quite unintelligible in terms of equivalence: they can
be understood only in the context of reversibility and inordinacy.
Thus the energy of New Yorkers flows from their fouled air, from their
speeded-up pace of life, from the panic and asphyxia created by their unimagi­
nably inhuman environment. It is even quite probable that drugs, and all the
compulsive activities that drugs bring in their train, also contribute to the level
of vitality and crudely metabolic vigour of the city. Everything plays a part ­
from the most refined activities to the most degraded: a total chain reaction.
Any notion of normal functioning has evaporated. All beings conspire (as one
might have said in the eighteenth century) in the same excess, the same
dramatic overexcitement, which, leaving the need to live far behind, has much
more to do with an unreal obsession with survival - with that glacial passion
for survival which seizes hold of everyone and feeds off its own ferocity.
To try to wean New Yorkers away from their extravagance and wasteful­
ness, or to get them to slow the inhuman rhythm at which they live, would be
mistaken on two counts. In the first place, they do not find their activity
exhausting, though it would be for normal people : on the contrary, they draw
an abnormal energy from it. Secondly, it would be humiliating for them if they
were obliged to slow down and economize on their energy flow; this would
represent a lowering of their collective status and compromise their claim to an
immoderation and urban mobility which are without equal in the world and of
which they all partake, whether consciously or unconsciously.
The dangers threatening the human species are thus less risks of default
(exhaustion of natural resources, dilapidation of the environment, etc.) than
risks of excess: runaway energy flows, chain reactions, or frenzied autonomous
developments. This distinction is a vital one, for while risks of default can be

addressed by a New Political Ecology, the basic assumptions of which are by
now generally accepted (indeed, they are already written into the International
Rights of the Species), there is absolutely nothing to counter this other
immanent logic, this speeding-up of everything, which plays double or
nothing with nature. In the first case, the restoration of equilibrium to our
ecological niche is still possible, the energies in play could still be rebalanced; in
the second case, however, we are confronted by a development that is
irretrievably out of balance. In the first case ethical principles may be brought
to bear: a teleology that transcends the material process involved - even if
merely the goal of survival - may come into play; in the second case, however,
a process whose only goal is limitless proliferation will inevitably absorb all
transcendence and devour all agents thereof. A full-blown and planet-wide
schizophrenia, therefore, now rules: even as all sorts of ecological measures are
being taken, even as a strategy for the proper use of the world, for an ideal
interaction with the world, is being deployed, there is a simultaneous prolifer­
ation of enterprises of destruction, a total unleashing of the performance
principle. And the very same forces often contribute to both trends.
Furthermore, though the end-point of the first tendency seems fairly clear
- to wit, the saving of our species by means of ecological conviviality - we
know absolutely nothing about the secret destination of the second. But surely
this acceleration, this excentric motion, must have an end, must imply a destiny
for the human species, a different symbolic relationship with the world that is
much more complex and ambiguous than a relationship of balance and
interaction? This too would be a vital destination - but it would involve a total
risk.
If such a destination has indeed been chosen for us, it is obvious that
ecology's rational deities will be powerless against the throwing of technology
and energy into the struggle for an unpredictable goal, in a sort of Great Game
whose rules are unknown to us. Even now we have no protection against the
perverse effects of security, control and crime-prevention measures. We

already know to what dangerous extremities we are led by prophylaxis in
every sphere: social, medical, economic or political. In the name of the highest
possible degree of security, an endemic terror may well be instituted that is in
every way as dangerous as the epidemic threat of catastrophe. One thing is
certain: in view of the complexity of the initial conditions and the potential
reversibility of all the effects, we should entertain no illusions about the
effectiveness of any kind of rational intervention. In the face of a process which
so far surpasses the individual or collective will of the players, we have no
choice but to accept that any distinction between good and evil (and by
extension here any possibility of assessing the 'right level' of technological
development) can have the slightest validity only within the tiny marginal
sphere contributed by our rational model. Inside these bounds, ethical reflec­
tion and practical determinations are feasible; beyond them, at the level of the
overall process which we have ourselves set in motion, but which from now on
marches on independently of us with the ineluctability of a natural cata­
strophe, there reigns - for better or worse - the inseparability of good and evil,
and hence the impossibility of mobilizing the one without the other. This is,
properly speaking, the theorem of the accursed share. There is no point whatso­
ever in wondering whether things ought to be thus: they simply are thus, and
to fail to acknowledge it is to fall utterly prey to illusion. None of this
invalidates whatever may be possible in the ethical, ecological or economic
sphere of our life - but it does totally relativize the impact of such efforts upon
the symbolic level, which is the level of destiny.

THE THE OREM OF THE
ACCURSED SHARE

The uninterrupted production of positivity has a terrifying consequence.
Whereas negativity engenders crisis and critique, hyperbolic positivity for its
part engenders catastrophe, for it is incapable of distilling crisis and criticism in
homeopathic doses. Any structure that hunts down, expels or exorcizes its
negative elements risks a catastrophe caused by a thoroughgoing backlash,
just as any organism that hunts down and eliminates its germs, bacteria,
parasites or other biological antagonists risks metastasis and cancer - in other
words, it is threatened by a voracious positivity of its own cells, or, in the viral
context, by the prospect of being devoured by its own - now unemployed antibodies.
Anything that purges the accursed share in itself signs its own death
warrant. This is the theorem of the accursed share.
The energy of the accursed share, and its violence, are expressions of the
principle of Evil. Beneath the transparency of the consensus lies the opacity of
evil - the tenacity, obsessiveness and irreducibility of the evil whose contrary
energy is at work everywhere: in the malfunctioning of things, in viral attacks,

in the acceleration of processes and in their wildly chaotic effects, in the
overriding of causes, in excess and paradox, in radical foreignness, in strange
attractors, in linkless chains of events.
The principle of Evil is not a moral principle but rather a principle of
instability and vertigo, a principle of complexity and foreignness, a principle of
seduction, a principle of incompatibility, antagonism and irreducibility. It is
not a death principle - far from it. It is a vital principle of disjunction. Since the
Garden of Eden, which Evil's advent closed to us, Evil has been the principle of
knowledge. But if indeed we were chased from the Garden for the sin of
knowledge, we may as well draw the maximum benefit from it. Trying to
redeem the accursed share or the principle of Evil can result only in the
establishment of new artificial paradises, those of the consensus, which for
their part do indeed embody a true death principle.
To analyse present-day systems in their catastrophic reality, to consider
not only their failures and aporias but also the way in which they sometimes
succeed only too well and get lost in the delusion of their own functioning, is to
come face to face at every turn with the theorem or equation of the accursed
share, and to find its indestructible symbolic power confirmed every time.
Going over to the side of the principle of Evil implies making a choice in
every sphere that is not only critical but also criminal. In any society, even a
liberal one (such as ours!), this kind of choice cannot be publicly expressed . A
stated position in support of the non-human or of the principle of Evil will be
rejected by any value system (by 'principle of Evil' here I mean nothing more
than the simple stating of a few hard truths concerning values, law, power,
reality, etc.). In this respect there is no difference at all between East, West,
North or South. And there is not the slightest chance of seeing an end to this
intolerant attitude, as opaque and crystalline as a glass wall, which no progress
in the sphere of either morality or immorality has managed to modify.
The world is so full of positive feelings, naive sentimentality, self-impor­
tant rectitude and sycophancy that irony, mockery and the subjective energy of

evil are always in the weaker position. At this rate every last negative senti­
ment will soon be forced into a clandestine existence. Already the merest gibe
tends to meet with incomprehension. It will soon be impossible to express
reservations about anything at all. We shall have nothing left but disgust and
consternation.
Fortunately, the evil genie has taken up residence in things: this is the
objective energy of evil. No matter how we choose to describe whatever it is that
seeks thus to find a way forward - the accursed share, or strange attractors,
destiny, or a hypersensitive response to initial conditions - we shall not be able
to avoid its ever-increasing strength, its exponential trajectory or the veritable
pataphysics of incommensurable effects that it will generate. The excentric
development of our systems is ineluctable . As Hegel put it, we are amid 'the
life, moving of itself, of that which is dead'. Once certain limits have been
passed there is no relationship between cause and effect, merely viral relation­
ships between one effect and another, and the whole system is driven by
inertia alone. The development of this increase in strength, this velocity and
ferocity of what is dead, is the modern history of the accursed share. It is not up
to us to explain this: rather, we must be its mirror in real time. We must outpace
events, which themselves long ago outpaced liberation. The reign of incoher­
ence, anomaly and catastrophe must be acknowledged, as must the vitality of
all those extreme phenomena which toy with extermination while at the same
time answering to certain mysterious rules.
It is in the nature of Evil, as it is in the nature of the accursed share, that it
regenerates in proportion as it is expended. Economically speaking this is
outrageous, much as the inseparability of Good and Evil can be outrageous
from a metaphysical point of view. But if violence is thus done to reason, we
must nevertheless acknowledge the vitality of this violence, the vitality of an
unforeseeable inordinacy which carries things beyond their original goals and
makes them hyper dependent on other ultimate ends (but which?).

All liberation affects Good and Evil equally. The liberation of morals and
minds entails crimes and catastrophes. The liberation of law and pleasure leads
inevitably to the liberation of crime (something which Sade understood weIl ­
and for that he has never been forgiven).
In the USSR perestroika has been characterized not only by ethnic and
political demands but also by a surge of accidents and natural catastrophes
(including crimes and accidents of the past, now disinterred) . A kind of
spontaneous terrorism has emerged in response to liberalization and the
extension of human rights. All this, we are told, was already there - but
censored . (One of the most deeply felt criticisms directed against the former
Stalinist regime is that it deprived us of the many bloody events it censored,
thus rendering them useless save as part of a political unconscious to be
inherited by future generations; that it froze or deep-froze the titillating and
bloodcurdling details of these crimes; and that, like the Nazis in the case of the
Holocaust (another almost perfect crime), it flouted the universal law of
information.
But there is more to this phenomenon than the lifting of censorship: the
fact is that crime, delinquency and catastrophe rush towards the screen of
glasnost like flies towards artificial light (why, incidentally, are flies never
attracted to natural light?) . This catastrophic surplus-value arises from an
enthusiasm, almost a passion, on the part of nature, and equally from a
spontaneous propensity of technology to indulge its own whims as soon as the
political conditions are ripe . Frozen out for so long, crimes and catastrophes
thus make their j oyous and official entrance. If they did not exist they would
have to be invented, for there can be no question that they are ultimately the
true signs of freedom and the natural disorder of the world.
The totality constituted by Good and Evil together transcends us, but we
should accept it totally. There can be no intelligence of things so long as this
fundamental rule is ignored . The illusion that the two can be distinguished in

order to promote one or the other is absurd. (This applies to the proponents of
evil for evil's sake as much as to anyone else, for they will end up doing good.)
All kinds of events are out there, impossible to predict. They have already
occurred, or are just about to heave into view. All we can do is train our
searchlight, as it were, and keep our telescopic lens on this virtual world in the
hope that some of those events will be obliging enough to allow themselves to
be captured. Theory can be no more than this: a trap set in the hope that reality
will be naive enough to fall into it.
The essential thing is to point the searchlight the right way. Unfortunately,
we don't know which way that is. We can only comb the sky. In most instances
the events are so far away, metaphysically speaking, that they merely cause a
slight phosphorescence on the screen. They have to be developed and
enlarged, like photographs. Not in order to discover their meaning, however:
they are not logograms, but holograms. They can no more be exp lained than the
fixed spectrum of a star or the variations of red.
To capture such strange events, theory itself must be remade as something
strange: as a perfect crime, or as a strange attractor.

RADICAL OTHERNESS

The Medusa represents an otherness so radical that one cannot look
at her and live.

THE HELL OF THE SAME

Of all the prostheses that punctuate the history of the body, the double is
doubtless the most ancient. The double, however, is not properly speaking a
prosthesis at all. Rather, it is an imaginary figure, like the soul, the shadow or
the mirror-image, which haunts the subject as his 'other', causing him to be
himself while at the same time never seeming like himself. The double haunts
the subject like a subtle death, but a death forever being conjured away. Things
are not always like this, however - for when the double materializes, when it
becomes visible, it signifies imminent death.
In other words, the double's imaginary power and resonance - the level
upon which the subject's simultaneous estrangement from himself and inti­
macy with himself are played out - depends upon its lack of material being,
upon the fact that the double is and remains a phantasy. Everyone may dream
- and everyone no doubt does dream all his life long - of a perfect duplicate, or
perfect multiple copies, of his own being; but the strength of such copies lies
precisely in their dream quality, and is lost as soon as any attempt is made to
force dream into reality. The same is true of the (primal) scene of seduction,
113

which is effective only so long as it is a phantasy, something re-remembered so long as it is never real. Ours is the only period ever to have sought to
exorcize this phantasy (along with others) - that is, to turn it into flesh and
blood, to transform the operation of the double from a subtle interplay
involving death and the Other into the bland eternity of the Same.
Clones. Cloning. The piping of humans ad infinitum, based on the fact that any
cell of an individuated organism may become the matrix of an identical
individual. A child is reported to have been born in the United States after the
fashion of a geranium - grown from a single cell taken from a single individual:
from a 'father', the sole genitor, of whom this offspring was a perfect replica or
twin.
The dream, then, of an eternal twinning as replacement for sexual procre­
ation, with its link to death. A cellular dream of scissiparity - the purest form of
parenthood in that it allows us at last to dispense with the other and go directly
from the one to the same . This is a unicellular utopia which, thanks to genetics,
gives complex beings access to the fate of the protozoans.
What, if not a death drive, would impel sexual beings towards a pre sexual
form of reproduction (in the depths of our imagination, moreover, is it not
precisely this scissiparous form of reproduction and proliferation based solely
on contiguity that for us is death and the death drive?). And what, if not a death
drive, would further impel us at the same time, on the metaphysical plane, to
deny all otherness, to shun any alteration in the Same, and to seek nothing
beyond the perpetuation of an identity, nothing but the transparency of a
genetic inscription no longer subject even to the vicissitudes of procreation?
But enough of the death drive. Are we faced here with a phantasy of self­
genesis? No, because such phantasies always involve the figures of the mother
and the father - sexed parental figures whom the subject may indeed yearn to
eliminate, the better to usurp their positions, but this in no sense implies
114

contesting the symbolic structure of procreation: if you become your own
child, you are still the child of someone. Cloning, on the other hand, radically
eliminates not only the mother but also the father, for it eliminates the
interaction between his genes and the mother's, the imbrication of the parents'
differences, and above all the joint act of procreation.
The cloner does not beget himself: he sprouts from each of his genes'
segments. One may well speculate about the value of such plant-like shoots,
which in effect resolve all Oedipal sexuality in favour of a 'non-human' sex, a
sex based on contiguity and unmediated propagation. But at all events the
phantasy of self-genesis is definitively out of the picture. Father and mother are
gone, but their disappearance, far from widening an aleatory freedom for the
subject, instead leaves the way clear for a matrix known as a code. No more
mother, no more father: j ust a matrix. And it is this matrix, this genetic code,
which is destined to 'give birth', from now till eternity, in an operational mode
from which all chance sexual elements have been expunged.
The subject, too, is gone, because identical duplication ends the division that
constitutes him. The mirror stage is abolished by the cloning process - or,
perhaps more accurately, is monstrously parodied therein. For the same
reason cloning keeps nothing of the timeless narcissistic dream of the subject's
projection into an ideal alter ego, for this projection too works by means of an
image - the image in the mirror, in which the subject becomes alienated in
order to rediscover himself, or that seductive and mortal image in which the
subject recognizes himself as a prelude to his death. Nothing of all this is left
with cloning. No more mediations - no more images: an individual product on
the conveyor belt is in no sense a reflection of the next (albeit identical) product
in line. The one is never a mirage, whether ideal or mortal, of the other: they
can only accumulate, and if that is so it is precisely because they have not been
sexually engendered and are unacquainted with death.

We are even beyond the realm of germination here, because true twins
have their own specificity as such, and enshrine the particular, and sacrosanct,
fascination of the Two - of that which has been two from the start, and has
never been One. The only thing cloning enshrines, by contrast, is the reiter­
ation of the same: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1, etc.
A clone is not a child, not a twin, not a narcissistic reflection; rather, it is the
materialization of a double by genetic means - in other words, the abolition of
all otherness and of the entire imaginary sphere.
A gene segment has no more need of an imaginary mediation in order to
reproduce than does an earthworm, any segment of which can reproduce
autonomously as an entire worm. Any cell of an American chief executive
officer likewise suffices to produce a new chief executive officer. Similarly, any
portion of a hologram may become the matrix of a new complete hologram:
each discrete portion of the original hologram contains all the information
needed for reproduction (though a slight loss of definition may occur) .
This is how the totality is eliminated. If all information is contained in each
of its parts, the whole loses its significance. This means the end of the body
also, the end of that unique object which we call the body, whose secret is
precisely that it cannot be broken down into an accumulation of cells because it
is an indivisible configuration - as witness the very fact that it is sexed.
Paradoxically, cloning is destined to continue producing sexed beings indefi­
nitely - clones must, of course, remain identical to their model - even as it turns
sex itself into a useless function; not that sex was ever a function : on the
contrary, it is what makes a body a body, something which transcends all that
body's diverse functions. Sex (or death) is something that transcends the
entirety of the information that can be collected concerning a given body. The
genetic formula, by contrast, contains all such information, but cannot trans­
cend it. It must therefore find its own autonomous path to reproduction,
independently of sexuality and death.

By breaking the body down into organs and functions, bio-physio-anatom­
ical science had already begun a process of analytical dissection of which
micromolecular genetics is merely a logical extension, though at a much higher
level of abstraction and simulation: at the nuclear level of the command cell directly at the level of the genetic code. And it is around genetics that this
whole phantasmagoria is organized.
The functional and mechanist view still treated each bodily organ as a partial
and differentiated prosthesis: simulation was already part of the picture, but
simulation of a 'traditional' kind. In the view of cybernetics and computer
science, by contrast, it is the smallest undifferentiated element, it is each cell of
the body, which becomes an 'embryonic' prosthesis for that body. The genetic
formula inscribed in each cell becomes the true modern prosthesis for all
bodies. A prosthesis, as normally understood, is an artifact which replaces a
defective organ, or an instrumental extension of the body; a DNA molecule,
however, which stores all information relative to a given body, is the ultimate
prosthesis in that it allows this body to be extended ad infinitum by itself 'itself'
being nothing more, now, than this infinite series of prostheses.
-

This cybernetic prosthesis is infinitely subtler, and more artificial, than any
mechanical one. For the genetic code has nothing 'natural' about it. Any part
abstracted from a whole and achieving autonomy from it becomes an artificial
prosthesis which alters that whole because it replaces it (an idea contained in
the etymology, 'pros + thesis') . Similarly, the genetic code - which, inasmuch as
it holds all the 'information' on a particular being, is in effect a condensation of
the whole of that being - may be described as an artifact, an abstract matrix
from which identical beings obeying identical commands will emerge, not
through reproduction but by virtue merely of a kind of lease-renewal. (This is
what makes genetic simulation so incredibly violent.)

My genetic inheritance was determined once and for all when a particular
spenn encountered a particular ovum. This inheritance includes the fonnula
of all the biochemical processes that brought me into being and ensure my
functioning. A copy of this formula is written into each and every one of the
tens of billions of cells of which I am at present composed . Each of these cells
knows how to manufacture me; before being a cell of my liver or my blood,
every cell is a cell of me . It is therefore theoretically possible to manufacture an
individual identical to me from any one of them. (A. Jacquard)

Cloning is thus the last stage in the history of the modelling of the body - the
stage at which the individual, having been reduced to his abstract and genetic
formula, is destined for serial propagation. It is worth recalling in this context
what Walter Benjamin had to say about the work of art in the age of its
mechanical reproduction. What is lost when a work is massively reproduced is
that work's 'aura', its unique here-and-now quality, its aesthetic form; at the
same time the work fated to reproduction in this manner assumes a political
form, according to Benjamin. What is lost is the original - which only a history
that is itself nostalgic and retrospective can restore in its I authenticity' . The
most advanced, most modem form of this development - which Benjamin
described in connection with contemporary cinema, photography and mass
media - is that form where the original no longer even exists, because the
objects in question are conceived of from the outset in terms of their limitless
leproduction.
With the advent of cloning, this kind of thing is occurring not j ust at the level of
messages but also in terms of individuals. Indeed, this is exactly what happens
to the body when it is conceived of as nothing more than a message, nothing
more than computer fodder. In such circumstances there is no obstacle in the
way of a mass reproduction of the body exactly comparable to the mass

reproduction of industrial objects and mass-media images described by Benja­
min. Thus reproduction precedes production, and the genetic model of the
body precedes all possible bodies. An exploding technology is what presides
over this reversal - that technology which Benjamin was already able to
describe, in its ultimate consequences, as a total medium; but Benjamin was
writing in the industrial era : by then technology itself was a gigantic prosthesis
governing the generation of identical objects and images which there was no
longer any way of distinguishing from one another, but it was as yet impossible
to foresee the technological sophistication of our own era, which has made it
possible to generate identical beings, without any means of returning to an
original. The prostheses of the industrial era were still external, exotechnical,
whereas those we know now are ramified and internalized esotechnical. Ours
is the age of soft technologies, the age of genetic and mental software.
-

So long as the prostheses of the old industrial golden age were merely
mechanical, they continued to have a retroactive effect upon the body, modify­
ing its image; inversely, they were themselves metabolized on the imaginary
level, and in their metabolized form became an integrated technological aspect
of the body image . But there is a point of no return in simulation: the point
when prostheses are introduced at a deeper level, when they are so completely
internalized that they infiltrate the anonymous and micromolecular core of the
body, when they impose themselves upon the body itself as the body's
'original' model, burning out all subsequent symbolic circuits in such a way
that every possible body is now nothing but an invariant reproduction of the
prosthesis: and this point means the end of the body, the end of its history, the
end of its vicissitudes. It means that the individual is now nothing but a
cancerous metastasis of his basic formula. How could all individuals cloned
from individual X be anything more than a cancerous metastasis - the propaga­
tion of a single cell such as may be observed in cancer? There is a close
connection between the key concept of the genetic code and the pathology of

cancer. Cancer implies an infinite proliferation of a basic cell in complete
disregard of the laws governing the organism as a whole. Similarly, in cloning,
all obstacles to the extension of the reign of the Same are removed; nothing
inhibits the proliferation of a single matrix. Formerly sexual reproduction
constituted a barrier, but now at last it has become possible to isolate the
genetic matrix of identity; consequently it will be possible to eliminate all the
differences that have hitherto made individuals charming in their
unpredictability .
If all cells are conceived of primarily as receptacles for a sole genetic
formula, then what are they - not only all identical individuals, but also all the
cells of a single individual - but the cancerous extension of that basic formula?
A process of metastasis that began with industrial products has ended in the
organization of cells. It is hardly worth asking whether cancer is a malady of
the capitalist era, for it is so clearly the disease which dominates the whole of
modern pathology. Cancer is the form of the virulence of the code: aggravated
redundancy of the same signals - aggravated redundancy of the same cells.
The body-as-scene changes in accordance with the irreversible 'progress'
of technology, and it is its overall scheme that undergoes metamorphosis.
Prostheses of the traditional kind, designed to replace defective organs, change
nothing so far as the general model of the body is concerned. The same applies
to organ grafts. But what of the mental shaping of the body caused by
psychotropic agents and drugs? It is the body-as-scene that is changed in this
way. The body under the influence of psychotropic agents is a body modelled
'from within', a body that is no longer subject to the perspectivist space of
representation, of mirrors and of discourse. A body silent, mental, already
molecular (no longer specular); a body metabolized directly, without media­
tion of act or look; a body immanent to itself, deprived of otherness, of
contextualization, of transcendence; a body abandoned to the implosive meta­
bolic vagaries of cerebral and endocrine flows; a sensory body, but not a
sensitive one, because it is connected up internally only - not to objects of

perception (which is why it may be imprisoned in a 'blank' or void sensory
world by simply disconnecting it from its own sensory nerve-endings and
without altering anything in the outside world); a body that is already
homogeneous, having reached a state of tactile plasticity, mental pliability and
susceptibility to psychotropic influences, from whatever direction they might
come, that is not far removed from nuclear and genetic manipulation - not far,
that is, from the absolute loss of the body image, from the condition of bodies
which cannot be represented at all, either for others or for themselves, the
condition of bodies enucleated of their being and meaning by virtue either of
transfiguration into a genetic formula or of biochemical influences: bodies
definitively removed from any possibility of resurrection.
We no longer practise incest, but we have generalized it in all its derivative
forms . The difference is that our version of incest is no longer sexual and
familial, but rather scissiparous and protozoan. This is how we have got round
the prohibition: by subdividing the Same, through a copulation between One
and the Same unmediated by the Other. This is still incest, but without the
tragedy. All the same, by giving material form - indeed, its most vulgar form ­
to this dangerous phantasy we have thereby also given material form to the
curse that attends it, to the original repulsion and disgust, which are now on
the increase in our societies as a function of the spread of this incestuous
situation. Perhaps even the hell of other people would have been preferable to
this return to the original form of an impossible kind of exchange.
Inasmuch as the individual no longer confronts the other, he finds himself
face to face with himself. On account of an aggressive backlash on the part of
his immune system, a dislocation of his own code and the destruction of his
own defences, the individual becomes in a sense an antibody to himself. Our
society is entirely dedicated to neutralizing otherness, to destroying the other
as a natural point of reference in a vast flood of aseptic communication and
interaction, of illusory exchange and contact. By dint of communication, our

society develops an allergy to itself. By becoming transparent in its genetic,
biological and cybernetic being, the body even develops an allergy to its own
shadow. Otherness denied becomes a spectre and returns in the form of a self­
destructive process. This, too, is the transparency of Evil.
Alienation is no more: the Other as gaze, the Other as mirror, the Other as
opacity - all are gone. Henceforward it is the transparency of others that
represents absolute danger. Without the Other as mirror, as reflecting surface,
consciousness of self is threatened with irradiation in the void.
The utopia of the end of alienation has likewise disappeared. The subject
has not succeeded in negating himself as subject, within the framework of a
totalization of the world. A determinate negation of the subject no longer
exists: all that remains is a lack of determinacy as to the position of the subject
and the position of the other. Abandoned to this indeterminacy, the subject is
neither the one nor the other - he is merely the Same. Division has been
replaced by mere propagation. And whereas the other may always conceal a
second other, the Same never conceals anything but itself. This is our done­
ideal today: a subject purged of the other, deprived of its divided character and
doomed to self-metastasis, to pure repetition.
No longer the hell of other people, but the hell of the Same.
Two brothers live in a castle. Each has a daughter, and the two daughters are
the same age . Both are sent away to school until they are eighteen. In the
carriage bringing them home, one of the cousins is suddenly taken ill and dies.
At the same moment, in the castle where he is awaiting her return, her father
also dies. So only one of the girls arrives home alive, and there her father
undresses her and offends nature by possessing her. At that very instant father
and daughter are levitated in the bedchamber, fly out through a window and
proceed to float above the surrounding countryside, petrified in their never­
ending incestuous embrace. The passing over of the unnaturally entwined

couple, flying without wings, sets up long negative vibrations which deeply
affect everything that lives in the harmonious countryside below . A general
disequilibrium, confused panic and an indefinable fear take over everywhere,
and things degenerate to the point where humans commit acts contrary to
reason, animals fall victim to illness and violent behaviour, and plants are filled
with anxiety. All relationships are disturbed. (Guido Ceronetti)

THE MELODRAMA
OF DIFFERENCE

So what became of otherness?
We are engaged in an orgy of discovery, exploration and 'invention' of the
Other. An orgy of differences. We are procurers of encounter, pimps of
interfacing and interactivity. Once we get beyond the mirror of alienation
(beyond the mirror stage that was the joy of our childhood), structural
differences multiply ad infinitum in fashion, in mores, in culture. Crude
otherness, hard otherness - the othernesses of race, of madness, of poverty are done with. Otherness, like everything else, has fallen under the law of the
market, the law of supply and demand. It has become a rare item - hence its
immensely high value on the psychological stock exchange, on the structural
stock exchange. Hence too the intensity of the ubiquitous simulation of the
Other. This is particularly striking in science fiction, where the chief question is
always 'What is the Other? Where is the Other?' Of course science fiction is
merely a reflection of our everyday universe, which is in thrall to a wild
speculation on - almost a black market in - otherness and difference. A

veritable obsession with ecology extends from Indian reservations to house­
hold pets (otherness degree zero!) - not to mention the other of 'the other
scene', or the other of the unconscious (our last symbolic capital, and one we
had better look after, because reserves are not limitless) . Our sources of
otherness are indeed running out; we have exhausted the Other as raw
material. (According to Claude Gilbert, we are so desperate that we go digging
through the rubble of earthquakes and catastrophes.)
Consequently the other is all of a sudden no longer there to be extermi­
nated, hated, rejected or seduced, but instead to be understood, liberated,
coddled, recognized . In addition to the Rights of Man, we now also need the
Rights of the Other. In a way we already have these, in the shape of a universal
Right to be Different. For the orgy is also an orgy of political and psychological
comprehension of the other - even to the point of resurrecting the other in places
where the other is no longer to be found. Where the Other was, there has the
Same come to be.
And where there is no longer anything, there the Other must come to be.
We are no longer living the drama of otherness. We are living the psychodrama
of otherness, just as we are living the psychodrama of 'sociality', the psycho­
drama of sexuality, the psychodrama of the body - and the melodrama of all
the above, courtesy of analytic metadiscourses. Otherness has become socio­
dramatic, semiodramatic, melodramatic.
All we do in psychodrama - the psychodrama of contacts, of psychological
tests, of interfacing - is acrobatically simulate and dramatize the absence of
the other. Not only is otherness absent everywhere in this artificial drama­
turgy, but the subject has also quietly become indifferent to his own subjecti­
vity, to his own alienation, just as the modern political animal has become
indifferent to his own political opinions. This subject becomes transparent,
spectral (to borrow Marc Guillaume's word) - and hence interactive. For in
interactivity the subj ect is the other to no one. Inasmuch as he is indifferent to
himself, it is as though he had been reified alive - but without his double,

without his shadow, without his other. Having paid this price, the subject
becomes a candidate for all possible combinations, all possible connections.
The interactive being is therefore born not through a new form of exchange
but through the disappearance of the social, the disappearance of otherness.
This being is the other after the death of the Other - not the same other at all:
the other that results from the denial of the Other.
The only interaction involved, in reality, belongs to the medium alone: to
the machine become invisible. Mechanical automata still played on the differ­
ence between man and machine, and on the charm of this difference something with which today's interactive and simulating automata are no
longer concerned . Man and machine have become isomorphic and indifferent
to each other: neither is other to the other.
The computer has no other. That is why the computer is not intelligent.
Intelligence comes to us from the other - always. That is why computers
perform so well. Champions of mental arithmetic and id iots savants are autistic
- minds for which the other does not exist and which, for that very reason, are
endowed with strange powers. This is the strength, too, of the integrated
circuit (the power of thought-transference might also be considered in this
connection) . Such is the power of abstraction. Machines work more quickly
because they are unlinked to any otherness. Networks connect them up to one
another like an immense umbilical cord joining one intelligence and its twin.
Homeostasis between one and the same: all otherness has been confiscated by
the machine.
Does otherness survive anywhere after being banished from this entire
psychodramatic superstructure?
Is there a physics as well as a metaphysics of the Other? Is there a dual, not
just a dialectical, form of otherness? Is there still a form of the Other as destiny,
and not merely as a psychological or social partner of convenience?

These days everything is described in terms of difference, but otherness is not
the same thing as difference. One might even say that difference is what
destroys otherness. When language is broken down into a set of differences,
when meaning is reduced to nothing more than differentiation, the radical
otherness of language is abolished. The duel that lies at the heart of language the duel between language and meaning, between language and the person
who speaks it - is halted. And everything in language that is irreducible to
mediation, articulation or meaning is eliminated - everything, that is, which
causes language at its most radical level to be other than the subject (and also
Other to the subj ect?). The existence of this level accounts for the play in
language, for its appeal in its materiality, for its susceptibility to chance; and it
is what makes language not just a set of trivial differences, as it is in the eyes of
structural analysis, but, symbolically speaking, truly a matter of life and death.
What, then, does it mean to say that women are the other for men, that the
mad are the other for the sane, or that primitive people are the other for
civilized people? One might as well go on for ever wondering who is the other
for whom. Is the Master the slave's other? Yes, certainly - in terms of class and
power relations. But this account is reductionistic. In reality, things are just not
so simple. The way in which beings and things relate to each other is not a
matter of structural difference . The symbolic order implies dual and complex
forms that are not dependent on the distinction between ego and other. The
Pariah is not the other to the Brahmin: rather, their destinies are different. The two
are not differentiated along a single scale of values: rather, they are mutually
reinforcing aspects of an immutable order, parts of a reversible cycle like the
cycle of day and night. Do we say that the night is the other to the day? No. So
why should we say that the masculine is the other to the feminine? For the two
are undoubtedly merely reversible moments, like night and day, following
upon one other and changing places with one another in an endless process of
seduction. One sex is thus never the other for the other sex, except within the
context of a differentialistic theory of sexuality - which is basically nothing but

a utopia. For difference is itself a utopia: the idea that such pairs of terms can be
split up is a dream - and the idea of subsequently reuniting them is another.
(This also goes for the distinction between Good and Evil: the notion that they
might be separated out from one another is pure fantasy, and it is even more
utopian to think in terms of reconciling them.) Only in the distinction-based
perspective of our culture is it possible to speak of the Other in connection with
sex. Genuine sexuality, for its part, is 'exotic' (in Segalen's meaning of the
term) : it resides in the radical incomparability of the sexes - otherwise
seduction would never be possible, and there would be nothing but alienation
of one sex by the other.
Differences mean regulated exchange. But what is it that introduces disorder
into exchange? What is it that cannot be negotiated over? What is it that has no
place in the contract, or in the structural interaction of differences?
What is founded on the impossibility of exchange?
Wherever exchange is impossible, what we encounter is terror. Any radical
otherness at all is thus the epicentre of a terror: the terror that such otherness
holds, by virtue of its very existence, for the normal world. And the terror that
this world exercises upon that otherness in order to annihilate it.
Over recent centuries all forms of violent otherness have been incorporated,
willingly or under threat of force, into a discourse of difference which simulta­
neously implies inclusion and exclusion, recognition and discrimination.
Childhood, lunacy, death, primitive societies - all have been categorized,
integrated and absorbed as parts of a universal harmony. Madness, once its
exclusionary status had been revoked, was caught up in the far subtler toils of
psychology. The dead, as soon as they were recognized in their identity as
such, were banished to outlying cemeteries - kept at such a distance that the
face of death itself was lost. As for Indians, their right to exist was no sooner

accorded them than they were confined to reservations. These are the vicissi­
tudes of a logic of difference.
Racism does not exist so long as the other remains Other, so long as the
Stranger remains foreign. It comes into existence when the other becomes
merely different - that is to say, dangerously similar. This is the moment when
the inclination to keep the other at a distance comes into being.
'We may assume', wrote Victor Segalen, 'that fundamental differences will
never resolve themselves into a truly seamless and unpatched fabric; increas­
ing unity, falling barriers and great reductions in real distance must of
themselves compensate somewhere by means of new partitions and unantici­
pated gaps:
Racism is one such 'new partition' . An abreaction to the psychodrama of
difference: a response to the phantasy of - and obsession with - becoming
'other' . A way out of the psychodrama of perpetual introjection and rejection
of the other. So intolerable is this introjection of differences, in fact, that the
other must be exorcized at all costs by making the differences materially
manifest. The biological claims of racism are without foundation but, by
making the racial reference clear, racism does reveal the logical temptation at
the heart of every structural system: the temptation to fetishize difference. But
differential systems can never achieve equilibrium: differences oscillate con­
stantly between absolute highs and absolute lows. When it comes to the
management of otherness and difference, the idea of a well-tempered balance
is strictly utopian.
Inasmuch as the humanist logic of difference is in some sense a universal
simulation (one which culminates in the absurdity of a 'right to difference'), it
leads directly, for all its benevolence, to that other desperate hallucination of
difference known as racism. As differences and the cult of differences continue
to grow, another, unprecedented kind of violence, anomalous and inaccessible
to critical rationality, grows even faster. Segalen's 'unanticipated gaps' are not

simply new differences: what springs up in order to combat the total homoge­
nization of the world is the Alien - monstrous metaphor for the corpse-like,
viral Other: the compound form of all the varieties of otherness done to death
by our system.
This is a racism which, for lack of any biological underpinning, seizes on
the very slightest variations in the order of signs; a racism which quickly takes
on a viral and automatic character, and perpetuates itself while revelling in a
generalized semiotics. And this racism can never be countered by any huma­
nism of difference, for the simple reason that it is itself the virus of difference.
Sermonizing on the internalization of the other and the introjection of
differences can never resolve the problem of the monstrous forms of otherness,
because these forms are the product, precisely, of this selfsame obsessional
differentiation, this selfsame obsessional dialectic of ego and other. Herein lies
the whole weakness of those 'dialectical' theories of otherness which aspire to
promote the proper use of difference. For if racism in its viral, immanent,
current and definitive form proves anything, it is that there is no such thing as
the proper use of difference .
This is why it may also be said that the critique of racism is substantially
finished - just as Marx said that the critique of religion was substantially
finished. Once the vacuousness of the metaphysical account of religion had
been demonstrated, religion was supposed to disappear as the conditions of a
more advanced mode of production became operative. Likewise, once the
vacuousness of the biological theory of races has been demonstrated, racism is
supposed to disappear as the conditions of a more advanced universal inter­
mixture of differences become operative. But what if religion, for example,
contrary to Marx's predictions, had lost its metaphysical and transcendent
form only to become an immanent force and fragment into countless ideologi­
cal and practical variants under the conditions of a religious revival drawing
sustenance from the progress of the very social order that was expected to
eradicate even the memory of religion? For the signs of just such a turn of

events are all around us today. And much the same goes for racism, which has
also become an immanent, viral and everyday reality. The fact is that the
'scientific' and rational critique of racism is a purely formal one, which
demolishes the argument from biology but remains caught in the racist trap
because it addresses a biological illusion only, and fails to deal with biology
itself qua illusion. Similarly, the political and ideological critique of racism is
purely formal in that it tackles the racist obsession with difference without
tackling difference itself qua illusion. It thus itself becomes an illusion of
criticism, bearing on nothing, and in the end racism turns out to have survived
critique by rationalism just as deftly as religion survived critique by materia­
lism - which is why all such critiques are indeed substantially finished.
There is no such thing as the proper use of difference - a fact revealed not
only by racism itself but also by all anti-racist and humanitarian efforts to
promote and protect differences. Humanitarian ecumenism, the ecumenism of
differences, is in a cul-de-sac: the cul-de-sac of the concept of the universal
itself. The most recent illustration of this, in France, was the brouhaha over the
wearing of headscarves for religious reasons by North African schoolgirls. All
the rational arguments mustered in this connection turned out to be nothing
but hypocritical attempts to get rid of the simple fact that no solution is to be
found in any moral or political theory of difference. It is difference itself that is a
reversible illusion. We are the ones who brought difference to the four corners
of the earth: that it should now be returned to us in unrecognizable, Islamic,
fundamentalist and irreducible forms is no bad thing.
The guilt we feel in this connection assumes gigantic proportions. Not long
ago the organization Medecins Sans Frontieres became aware that the medical
supplies it had been distributing in Afghanistan were being resold rather than
used directly by their recipients. This precipitated a crisis of conscience for the
programme' s organizers . Should donations be discontinued, or should this
immoral and irregular commerce be tolerated out of respect for 'cultural
differences'? After much soul-searching it was decided to sacrifice Western

values on the altar of difference, and continue to underwrite the black market
in medicines. Humanisme oblige.
Another charming illustration of the confusion besetting our humani­
tarians concerns X, posted to the Sudan to study 'the communications needs of
Sudanese peoples' . Seemingly, the Sudanese did not know how to communi­
cate. But they were certainly hungry, and needed to learn how to grow
sorghum. Sending agronomists being too expensive a prospect, the decision
had been taken to teach by videocassette. The time had come for the Sudanese
to join the communications revolution: sorghum via audio and video. No
hook-up, no eat. It was not long before towns and villages were crammed with
VCRs. A little longer, and the local mafia created a lucrative market for itself in
pornographic videotapes which held a distinctly greater interest for the
populace than educational cassettes on sorghum cultivation. Porno-Sorgho­
Video: The Same Struggle!
The risibility of our altruistic 'understanding' is rivalled only by the
profound contempt it is designed to conceal. For 'We respect the fact that you
are different' read: 'You people who are underdeveloped would do well to
hang on to this distinction because it is all you have left' . (The signs of folklore
and poverty are excellent markers of difference.) Nothing could be more
contemptuous - or more contemptible - than this attitude, which exemplifies
the most radical form of incomprehension that exists. It has nothing to do,
however, with what Segalen calls 'eternal incomprehensibility' . Rather, it is a
product of eternal stupidity - of that stupidity which endures for ever in its
essential arrogance, feeding on the differentness of other people.
Other cultures, meanwhile, have never laid claim to universality. Nor did
they ever claim to be different - until difference was forcibly injected into them
as part of a sort of cultural opium war. They live on the basis of their own
singularity, their own exceptionality, on the irreducibility of their own rites and
values. They find no comfort in the lethal illusion that all differences can be
reconciled - an illusion that for them spells only annihilation.

To master the universal symbols of otherness and difference is to master the
world. Those who conceptualize difference are anthropologically superior naturally, because it is they who invented anthropology. And they have all the
rights, because rights, too, are their invention. Those who do not conceptualize
difference, who do not play the game of difference, must be exterminated. The
Indians of America, when the Spanish landed, are a case in point. They
understood nothing about difference; they inhabited radical otherness. (The
Spaniards were not different in their eyes: they were simply gods, and that was
that.) This is the reason for the fury with which the Spaniards set about
destroying these peoples, a fury for which there was no religious justification,
nor economic justification, nor any other kind of justification, except for the
fact that the Indians were guilty of an absolute crime: their failure to under­
stand difference. When they found themselves obliged to become part of an
otherness no longer radical, but negotiable under the aegis of the universal
concept, they preferred mass self-immolation - whence the fervour with which
they, for their part, allowed themselves to die : a counterpart to the Spaniards'
mad urge to kill. The Indians' strange collusion in their own extermination
represented their only way of keeping the secret of otherness.
Cortes, the Jesuits, the missionaries and, later on, the anthropologists even Tzvetan Todorov himself in his Conquest of America - all came down on the
side of negotiable otherness. (Las Casas is the sole exception: towards the end
of his life he suggested that the Conquest be purely and simply abandoned,
and that the Indians be put back in the hands of their own destiny.) All these
enlightened souls believe in a proper use of difference . The radical Other is
intolerable : he cannot be exterminated, but he cannot be accepted either, so the
negotiable other, the other of difference, has to be promoted. This is where a
subtler form of extermination begins - a form involving all the humanist
virtues of modernity.
An alternative account of the extermination is that the Indians had to be
exterminated not because they were not Christians but because they were
1 33

more Christian than the Christians themselves. Their cruelty and their human
sacrifices were intolerable to the Spaniards not because they excited pity or
moral indignation but because this cruelty bore witness to the authority of their
gods and the strength of their beliefs. This force of conviction amongst the
Indians made the Spaniards ashamed at how little religion they themselves
had. It made a mockery of a Western culture which, behind its flimsy fac;ade of
faith, had no gods except gold and commerce . The Indians, with their implac­
able religiousness, made Western culture ashamed of its profanation of its own
values. Their fanaticism was intolerable because it was an implicit condemna­
tion and demystification of Western culture in its own eyes (the same role is
being played today by Islam) . This crime could not be expiated, and in itself
sufficiently justified the extermination of its perpetrators.
It is by no means clear that the other exists for everyone. Does the other
exist for the Savage or the Primitive? Some relationships are asymmetrical: the
one may be the other for the other without this implying that the other is the
other for the one. I may be other for him even though he is not the other for me .
The Alakaluf of Tierra del Fuego were wiped out without ever having
sought to understand the Whites, without ever even speaking to them or
negotiating with them. They called themselves 'Men' - and there were no
others. In their eyes the Whites were not even different: they were unintelli­
gible. They evinced no surprise at the newcomers' vast wealth and amazing
technology. Despite three centuries of contact, the Alakaluf adopted not a
single Western technique, continuing, for instance, to row around in skiffs.
The Whites might oppress and slaughter them, but it was for all the world as if
they did not exist. The Alakaluf were to be annihilated without conceding
anything of their otherness. They would never be assimilated - indeed, they
would never even reach the stage of difference. They would perish without
ever allowing the Whites the privilege of recognizing them as different. The
Alakaluf were simply irrecuperable. For the Whites, nevertheless, they were

'others' - beings that were different yet still human, or at least human enough
to be evangelized, exploited, and killed.
As a sovereign people the Alakaluf called themselves 'Men' . Then the
Whites applied to them the name that they had originally applied to the
Whites: 'Foreigners' . They eventually came to refer to themselves as 'for­
eigners' in their own language. In later times they called themselves 'Alakaluf'
- the only word that they still pronounced in front of Whites, meaning 'Give,
give' . They thus ended up with a designation connoting the mendacity to
which they had been reduced. First, then, they were themselves, then
strangers to themselves, and finally absent from themselves : three names
reflecting three stages of their extermination. Naturally their murder is to be
attributed to those who possess the universalizing vision, those who manipu­
late otherness for their own profit. In their singularity, which could not even
conceive of the Other, the Alakaluf were inevitably vanquished. But who can
say that the elimination of this singularity will not turn out, in the long run, to
be fatal for the Whites too? Who can say that radical foreignness will not have
its revenge - that, though effectively conjured away by colonial humanism, it
will not return in the form of a virus in the bloodstream of the Whites, dooming
them to disappear themselves one day in much the same way as the Alakaluf.
Everything is subservient to the system, yet at the same time escapes its
control. Those groups around the world who adopt the Western lifestyle never
really identify with it, and indeed are secretly contemptuous of it. They remain
excentric with respect to this value system. Their way of assimilating, of often
being more fanatical in their observance of Western manners than Westerners
themselves, has an obviously parodic, aping quality: they are engaged in a sort
of bricolage with the broken bits and pieces of the Enlightenment, of 'progress' .
Even when they negotiate or ally themselves with the West, they continue to
believe that their own way is fundamentally the right one . Perhaps, like the
Alakaluf, these groups will disappear without ever having taken the Whites

seriously. (For our part we take them very seriously indeed, whether our aim is
to assimilate them or destroy them: they are even fast becoming the crucial ­
negative - reference point of our whole value system.)
The Whites will perhaps themselves disappear one day without ever
having understood that their whiteness is merely the result of the promiscuity
and confusion of all races and cultures, just as the whiteness of white light is
simply the resolution of the melodrama of all colours. And just as colours
become comparable amongst themselves only when they are measured
against a universal scale of wavelengths, so cultures become comparable only
when they are set against a structural scale of differences. But there is a double
standard here, for it is only for Western culture that other cultures are different.
For those other cultures themselves, Whites are not even different - they are
non-existent, phantoms from another world. Outward conversion to Western
ways invariably conceals inward scoffing at Western hegemony. One is put in
mind of those Dogons who made up dreams to humour their psychoanalysts
and then offered these dreams to the analysts as gifts. Once we despised other
cultures; now we respect them. They do not respect our culture, however; they
feel nothing but an immense condescension for it. We may have won the right
by conquest to exploit and subjugate these cultures, but they have offered
themselves the luxury of mystifying us.
The strangest feeling one is left with after reading Bruce Chatwin' s Songlines is
a lingering perplexity about the reality of the 'lines' themselves: do these poetic
and musical itineraries, these songs, this 'dreamtime', really exist or not? In all
these accounts there is a hint of mystification; a kind of mythic optical illusion
seems to be operating. It is as though the Aboriginals were fobbing us off.
While unveiling the profoundest and most authentic of truths (the Austral
myth at its most mysterious), they also play up the most modern and hypothet­
ical of considerations: the irresolvability of any narrative, absolute doubt as to
the origins. For us to believe these fabulous things, we need to feel that they

themselves believe them. But these Aboriginals seem to take a mischievous
pleasure in being allusive and evasive. They give a few clues, but never tell us
the rules of the game, and one cannot help getting the impression that they are
improvising, pandering to our phantasies, but withholding any reassurance
that what they are telling us is true. This is doubtless their way of keeping their
secrets while at the same time poking fun at us - for in the end we are the only
people who want to believe these tales.
The Aboriginals' secret resides not in what they omit to say, however, but
entirely within the thread, within the indecipherable filigree of the narrative;
we are confronted by an ironic form here, by a mythology of appearances. And
in the manipulation of this form the Aboriginals are far more adept than we are.
We Whites are liable to remain mystified for a good while yet.
The simulation of Western values is universal once one gets beyond the
boundaries of our culture. Is it not true, though, that in our heart of hearts we
ourselves, who are neither Alakaluf nor Aboriginal, neither Dogon nor Arab,
fail signally to take our own values seriously? Do we not embrace them with
the same affectation and inner unconcern - and are we not ourselves equally
unimpressed by all our shows of force, all our technological and ideological
pretensions? Nevertheless, it will be a long time before the utopian abstraction
of our universal vision of differences is demolished in our own eyes, whereas
all other cultures have already given their own response - namely, universal
indifference.
It is not even remotely a matter of rehabilitating the Aboriginals, or finding
them a place in the chorus of human rights, for their revenge lies elsewhere. It
lies in their power to destabilize Western rule. It lies in their phantom presence,
their viral, spectral presence in the synapses of our brains, in the circuitry of
our rocketship, as IAlien'; in the way in which the Whites have caught the virus
of origins, of Indianness, of Aboriginality, of Patagonicity. We murdered all
this, but now it infects our blood, into which it has been inexorably transfused

and infiltrated. The revenge of the colonized is in no sense the reappropriation
by Indians or Aboriginals of their lands, privileges or autonomy: that is our
victory. Rather, that revenge may be seen in the way in which the Whites have
been mysteriously made aware of the disarray of their own culture, the way in
which they have been overwhelmed by an ancestral torpor and are now
succumbing little by little to the grip of 'dreamtime' . This reversal is a
worldwide phenomenon. It is now becoming clear that everything we once
thought dead and buried, everything we thought left behind for ever by the
ineluctable march of universal progress, is not dead at all, but on the contrary
likely to return - not as some archaic or nostalgic vestige (all our indefatigable
museumification notwithstanding), but with a vehemence and a virulence that
are modern in every sense - and to reach the very heart of our ultra­
sophisticated but ultra-vulnerable systems, which it will easily convulse from
within without mounting a frontal attack. Such is the destiny of radical
otherness - a destiny that no homily of reconciliation and no apologia for
difference is going to alter.

138

IRRECONCILABILITY

To the principle of conjunction and reconciliation stands opposed the principle
of disjunction and irreconcilability. From this confrontation the principle of
irreconcilability always emerges triumphant, because by definition it can never
give way to the principle of reconciliation.
The same sort of thing happens in the case of Good and Evil. The Good
consists in a dialectic of Good and Evil. Evil consists in the negation of this
dialectic, in a radical dissociation of Good and Evil, and by extension in the
autonomy of the principle of Evil. Whereas the Good presupposes a dialectical
involvement of Evil, Evil is founded on itself alone, in pure incompatibility. Evil
is thus master of the game, and it is the principle of Evil, the reign of eternal
antagonism, that must eventually carry off the victory.
When it comes to radical otherness between beings, sexes or cultures, we
find the same kind of antagonism as in the case of Evil, the same logic of
definitive incomprehensibility, the same bias in favour of foreignness. Is it
possible, then, to join forces with this foreignness? The answer is no, because
of the theorem which may be advanced, by analogy with the behaviour of

heavenly bodies, according to which bodies and minds are forever drawing
farther and farther away from each other. This hypothesis of an endless
process of excommunication, which subsumes the notion of an indissoluble
curse, is also, precisely, the hypothesis of the transparency of Evil - as opposed
to the universal utopia of communication. A hypothesis, therefore, that is
everywhere contradicted by the facts. But only apparently so, for in reality the
more things seem to become orientated towards universal comprehension and
universal homogenization, the more unavoidable becomes the idea of an
eternal irreducibility whose ineradicable presence is easier to sense than to
analyse.
This presence imposes itself as the brute fact, as the irresistible, suprasen­
sory, supranatural reality which is thrown up as a figure of fatality by the
impossibility of a dialectical theory of difference. A kind of universal force of
repulsion confronting the official universal force of attraction.
In its irreconcilability, this force is present in every culture. It is still at work
today in the relationships between the Third World and the West, between
Japan and the West, or between Europe and America, and also within each
culture, in the shape of those deviant forms which eventually come to
predominate. Morocco, Japan or Islam will never become Western. Europe will
never bridge the gulf of modernity that separates it from America. Cosmopoli­
tan evolutionism is an illusion, and it is everywhere being exposed as such.
There is no solution to Foreignness. It is eternal - and radical. It is not a
matter of wanting it to be that way. It simply is so.
This is Radical Exoticism: the rule governing the world. It is not a law, for the
law is the universal principle of understanding, the regulated interplay of
differences, moral, political and economic rationality. It is a rule and, like all
rules, implies an arbitrary predestination . Consider languages, none of which is
reducible to any other. Languages are predestined, each according to its own
rules, its own arbitrary determinants, its own implacable logic. Each obeys the

laws of communication and exchange, certainly, but at the same time it
answers to an indestructible internal coherence; a language as such is, and
must forever remain, fundamentally untranslatable into any other language.
This explains why all languages are so 'beautiful' - precisely because they are
foreign to one another.
A law is never ineluctable: it is a concept, founded upon a consensus. A
rule, by contrast, is indeed ineluctable, because it is not a concept but a form
that orders a game. Seduction illustrates this well. Eros is love - the force of
attraction, of fusion, of conjunction. Seduction is the far more radical figure
of disjunction, distraction, illusion and diversion, a figure that alters essence
and meaning, alters identity and the subject. And, contrary to common
belief, entropy is on the side not of universal disjunction but of conjunction
and fusion, of love and understanding - on the side of the proper use of
differences. Seduction - exoticism - is an excess of the other, of otherness, the
vertiginous appeal of what is 'more different than different' : this is what is
irreducible - and this is the true source of energy.
In

this predestined world of the Other, everything comes from elsewhere happy or unhappy events, illnesses, even thoughts themselves. All imperatives
flow from the non-human - from gods, beasts, spirits, magic. This is a universe
of fatality, not of psychology. According to Julia Kristeva we become estranged
from ourselves by internalizing the other, and this estrangement from our­
selves takes the form - among others - of the unconscious. But in the world of
fatality the unconscious does not exist. There is no universal form of the
unconscious, as psychoanalysis claims, and the only alternative to uncons­
cious repression is fatality - the imputation of everything to a completely non­
human agency, an agency which is external to the human and delivers us from
it.
The question of the Other in this fatal universe is the question of
hospitality.

Hospitality represents a reciprocal, ritualized and theatrical dimension.
Whom are we to receive, and how are we to receive them? What rules should
we follow here? For we exist solely to be received, and to receive (not to be
known and recognized) . This symbolic dimension is precisely what is missing
from communication, in which the message is merely decoded, never given or
received. The message is passed - but there is no exchange between people.
The abstract dimension of meaning is transmitted, while the aspect of reci­
procity is short-circuited .
The Other i s my guest. Not someone who i s legally equal, though different;
but a foreigner, a stranger, extraneus . And for this very reason, his strangeness
has to be exorcized. But once he has been initiated in due form, my guest's life
becomes even more precious to me than my own. In this symbolic universe
there is no place for the otherness of difference. Neither animals, nor gods, nor
the dead, are other. All are caught up in the same cycle. If you are outside the
cycle, however, you do not even exist.
All other cultures are extraordinarily hospitable: their ability to absorb is
phenomenal. Whereas we waver between the other as prey and the other as
shadow, between predation pure and simple and an idealizing recognition,
other cultures still retain the capacity to incorporate what comes to them from
without, including what comes from our Western universe, into their own
rules of the game. They may perform this recycling operation instantaneously
or over the long term, but in no case are their code and basic arrangements
threatened thereby. Precisely because they do not live by the illusion of a
universal law, they are not rendered oversensitive as are we, who are con­
stantly being commanded to internalize the law and to make ourselves the
origin of our own selves, acts, tastes and pleasures. Primitive cultures do not
burden themselves with pretensions of this order. Being oneself means
nothing to them: everything comes from the Other. There is no such thing as
oneself, nor is there any call for such a thing.

From this point of view there is not much difference between Japan and
Brazil, or between either of them and Jean Rouch's 'manic priests' : all are
cannibals in the sense that they offer a lethal hospitality to values that are not
and never will be theirs.
The strength of the Japanese lies in the kind of hospitality they accord to
technology and to all forms of modernity (just as, in the past, they opened their
doors to religion and writing) . Their hospitality involves no psychological
internalization or commitment on their part, however, and things are kept
strictly at the level of codes. It is more a form of challenge than an offer of
reconciliation or recognition: their own impenetrability remains total. This is,
literally, a sort of seduction whereby something - a sign, a technique or an
object - is diverted from its own essence and made to function in another code;
or - to put it another way - made to pass from the realm of laws (capital, value,
economy, meaning) into the realm of rules (play, rituals, ceremonies, cycles,
repetition) .
Japanese dynamism corresponds to neither the value system nor the goals
of the Western project. Its practical applications manifest a distantiation and
operational purity unencumbered by the ideologies and beliefs that have
shaped the history of capital and technology in the West. The Japanese are the
great play-actors of technology, unknowingly upholding in the sphere of
technology the paradox of the actor in the theatre : the most effective actor must
have detachment, he must have rules to go by, and his own inspiration must
come from outside - from the role, or from the technical obj ect, as the case may
be. Oapanese industrialists believe that there is a god concealed within each
product of technology, making it autonomous and infusing it with its own
inner spirit.) Technology is to be played with as signs are played with: the
subject should efface himself completely, meaning should be at its most
elliptical - in short, pretence should be the order of the day.

Symbolic rituals can absorb anything, including the organless body of
capitalism. They obviate any need to leave one's own ground, and involve
neither Heideggerian speculation on technology's relationship to the origins
and to being, nor psychological internalization. The Japanese challenge the
West on its own terms, but their strategy is infinitely more effective: the
strategy of a value system that can afford the luxury of technology, of a technologi­
cal practice founded on pure artifice and having absolutely nothing to do with
progress or similar rational forms. For us this pure strategy, this cold and
painstaking efficiency, so different from the trivial modernity of the West, is an
enigmatic and indeed unintelligible form. In this sense it is one of those forms
that Segalen describes as radical exoticism, and one which is all the more
startling in that it I affects' the ways of an overdeveloped society while at the
same time retaining all primitive society' s power of ritual.
Japanese culture is thus a cannibalistic form - assimilating, absorbing,
aping, devouring. Afro-Brazilian culture is also a rather good example of
cannibalism in this sense: it too devours white modern culture, and it too is
seductive in character. Cannibalism must indeed always be merely an extreme
form of the relationship to the other, and this includes cannibalism in the
relationship of love. Cannibalism is a radical form of hospitality.
This is not to say that the race question is any nearer resolution in Brazil
than anywhere else - simply that racist ideology faces a more difficult task in
Brazil on account of the racial confusion and the range of race mixtures that
exist there. Discrimination confronts a web of racial lines as unpredictable as
the lines of the human palm. This invalidation of racism by virtue of the
scattering of its object is far more subtle and effective than ideological struggle,
whose ambiguity invariably revives the very problem it seeks to resolve.
Racism will never end so long as it is combated frontally in terms of rational
rebuttal. It can be defeated only through an ironic give-and-take founded
precisely on racial differences: not at all through the legitimation of differences
by legal means, but through an ultimately violent interaction grounded in
144

seduction and voracity. One thinks of the Bishop of Pernambuco; one thinks of
the words 'How good he was, my little Frenchman!' He is very good-looking,
so he is sanctified - and eaten. He is granted something greater than the right
to exist: the prestige of dying. If racism is a violent abreaction in response to the
Other's seductive power (rather than to the Other's difference), it can surely be
defused only by an increase in seductiveness itself.
So many other cultures enjoy a more original situation than ours. For us
everything is predictable: we have extraordinary analytical means but no
situation to analyse . We live theoretically well beyond our own events: hence
our deep melancholy. For others destiny still flickers: they live it, but it remains
for them, in life as in death, something forever indecipherable. As for us, we
have abolished 'elsewhere' . Cultures stranger than ours live in prostration
(before the heavens, before destiny); we live in consternation (at the absence of
destiny). Nothing can come from anywhere except from us. This is, in a way,
the most absolute misfortune.

145

RADICAL EXOTICISM

The very scale of the efforts made to exterminate the Other i s testimony to the
Other's indestructibility, and by extension to the indestructible totality of
Otherness.
Such is the power of this idea, and such is the power of the facts.
Radical otherness survives everything: conquest, racism, extermination, the
virus of difference, the psychodrama of alienation. On the one hand, the Other
is always-already dead; on the other hand, the Other is indestructible.
This is the Great Game.
The ultimate inscrutability of beings, as of peoples.
Segalen: 'The inscrutability of races, which is merely the extension to races
of the inscrutability of individuals.'
The survival of exoticism depends entirely on the impossibility of
encounter, fusion and the exchange of differences. Fortunately, all this is an
illusion - the illusion of subjectivity itself.

All that endures is the foreignness of the foreigner, the irredeemability of
the object.
No psychology: psychology is always the worst way to go.
Avoid all psychological, ideological and moral forms of the Other - eschew
the metaphor of the Other, the Other as metaphor.
Seek the Other's 'cruelty', the Other's unintelligibility, the Other as
spectre: constrain the Other to foreignness, violate the Other in his
foreignness.
Running to ground of metaphor: sublime form of metaphorical violation.
Radical anti-ethnology, anti-universalism, anti-differentialism.
Radical exoticism versus the pimping of differences.

Segalen summed things up with regard to the discovery of the world and of
other cultures: once the Earth had been circumscribed as a sphere, as a finite
space, thanks to all-powerful means of communication, what remained was
the inevitability of a circular tourism wearing itself out in the absorption of all
differences, in the most trivial form of exoticism. Nevertheless, having identi­
fied this fatal entropy, this levelling of all cultures, and the consequent
impossibility of travel, Segalen proceeds to revive the grand prospect of an
Essential or Radical Exoticism.
Exoticism is the acute and immediate perception of an eternal incom­
prehensibility .

What triumphs, then, is not the rule of difference and lack of differentiation but
instead an eternal incomprehensibility, the irreducible foreignness of cultures,
manners, faces, languages .

The irredeemability of the object: 'The essential exoticism is that which the
Object has for the Subject.' Exoticism as the fundamental law of the intensity of
sensations, of the exaltation of the senses, and thus of living itself . . .
'All men are subject to the law of exoticism.'
Is it really a law? Is the theory of exoticism ethical or aesthetic? Is it a
philosophy, an art of living, a vision of the world? Is it impressionistic or
doctrinal? For Segalen, it is an unavoidable hypothesis and a source of
pleasure.
Radical otherness is simultaneously impossible to find and irreducible.
Impossible to find as otherness per se (obviously a dream); but at the same time---­
irreducible as a symbolic rule of the game, as a rule of the game that governs
the world. The promiscuity and general confusion in which differences exist
do not affect this rule of the game as such: it is not a rational law, nor is it a
demonstrative process - we shall never have either metaphysical or scientific
proof of this principle of foreignness and incomprehensibility: we simply have
to accept it.
The worst thing here is understanding, which is sentimental and useless.
True knowledge is knowledge of exactly what we can never understand in the
other, knowledge of what it is in the other that makes the other not oneself and hence someone who can in no sense become separated from oneself, nor
alienated by any look of ours, nor instituted by us in either identity or
difference. (Never question others about their identity. In the case of America,
the question of American identity was never at issue: the issue was America's
foreignness.) If we do not understand the savage, it is for the same reason that
he does not understand himself (the term 'savage' conveys this foreignness
better than all later euphemisms) .
The rule of exoticism thus implies that one should not be fooled by
understanding, by intimacy, by the country, by travel, by picturesqueness, or
by oneself. The realm of radical exoticism, moreover, is not necessarily a

function of travel: 'It is not essential, in order to feel the shock [of the exotic I, to
revive the old-fashioned episode of the voyage. [ . . . I The fact remains that
such an episode and its setting are better than any other subterfuge for
reaching this brutal, rapid and pitiless hand-to-hand conflict and making each
blow count.' Travel is a subterfuge, then - but it is the most appropriate one of
all.
The power of the antipodes: the critical power of travel. The finest period of the

America. Try not to apprehend the other as difference. This is Segalen's
principle of l'Exote. No pretension to truth. Disgust for trivial exoticism. At the
same time, do not seek to abolish oneself in face of the other. That was Isabelle
Eberhardt's temptation: fused form equals mystical confusion. Her response to
the question 'How can one be an Arab?' was to try to become an Arab, by
rejecting her own foreignness. It was inevitable that she should die as a result,
and it was an Arab who cast her into the sea to erase her apostasy. Rimbaud, for
his part, never sought fusion. His foreignness with respect to his own culture
was too great for him to need any mystical diversion.
Patagonia. Phantasy of disappearance . The disappearance of the Indians, your
own disappearance, that of all culture, all landscape, in the bleakness of your
mists and ice. In essence, though, all these things are disappearing right here in
Europe too: we are all Alakaluf. Why this geographical dispersion? The last
word here is that it is better to put an end to a process of creeping disappear­
ance (ours) by means of a live sojourn in a visible form of disappearance. All
translations into action are imaginary solutions. That is why 'Patagonia' goes
so well with 'Pataphysics', which is the science of imaginary solutions. Pata­

What we seek in travel is neither discovery nor trade but rather a gentle
deterritorialization: we want to be taken over by the journey - in other words,
by absence. As our metal vectors transcend meridians, oceans and poles,
absence takes on a fleshly quality. The clandestineness of the depths of private
life gives way to annihilation by longitude and latitude. But in the end the body
tires of not knowing where it is, even if the mind finds this absence exalting, as
if it were a quality proper to itself.
Perhaps, after all, what we seek in others is the same gentle deterritorialization
that we seek in travel. Instead of one's own desire, instead of discovery, we are
tempted by exile in the desire of the other, or by the desire of the other as an
ocean to cross. The looks and gestures of lovers already have the distance of
exile about them; the language of lovers is an expatriation in words that are
afraid to signify; and the bodies of lovers are a tender hologram to eye and
hand, offering no resistance and hence susceptible of being crisscrossed, like
airspace, by desire . We move around with circumspection on a mental planet
of circumvolutions, and from our excesses and passions we bring back the
same transparent memories as we do from our travels.
Travel is comparable to relationships with others. The voyage as metamorpho­
sis, as anamorphosis, of the Earth. The feminine as metamorphosis and
anamorphosis of the masculine. Transference as deliverance from one's own
sex or one's own culture. It is this form of travel, founded on expulsion and
deliverance, that has now taken the place of the classical voyage, the voyage of
discovery. Travel today is spatial and orbital, vectored - the kind of travel
which, by virtue of its speed, also plays with time. Such is the voyage in the
Age of Aquarius: a voyage into versatility, into the reversibility of seasons and
cultures. Escape from the illusion of intimacy.

Once the peripheral extension of a central activity, a diversion from an
enduring place of origin, travel has all of a sudden changed its meaning: it now
constitutes an original dimension, the dimension of no return, the new primal
scene. It has thus become truly exotic - the future's answer to the former
decentredness of primitive society. At the same time, whereas travel once
served to confirm the increasing monotony of countries and peoples, the
planet-wide levelling of cultures, and was pursued with the masochism that
underlies the illusions of the tourist, travel now leads, by contrast, to radical
exoticism, and serves to confirm the fundamental incompatibility of cultures.
Travel was once a means of being elsewhere, or of being nowhere . Today it is
the only way we have of feeling that we are somewhere. At home, surrounded
by information, by screens, I am no longer anywhere, but rather everywhere in
the world at once, in the midst of a universal banality - a banality that is the
same in every country. To arrive in a new city, or in a new language, is
suddenly to find oneself here and nowhere else. The body rediscovers how to
look. Delivered from images, it rediscovers the imagination.
What could be more closely bound up with travel, with the anamorphosis of
travel, than photography? What could be closer to travel in its origins? Hence
photography's affinity with everything that is savage and primitive, and with
that most essential of exoticisms, the exoticism of the Object, of the Other.
The most beautiful of all photographs are those taken of savages in their
natural surroundings. The savage is always confronting death, and he con­
fronts the lens in exactly the same manner. He does not ham it up, nor is he
indifferent. He always poses; he faces up to the camera. His achievement is to
transform this technical operation into a face-to-face confrontation with death.
This is what makes these pictures such powerful and intense photographic
objects. As soon as the lens fails to capture this pose, this provocative obscenity
of the object facing death, as soon as the subject begins to collude with the lens,

and the photographer too becomes subjective, the ' great game' of photography
is over. Exoticism is dead. Today it is very hard indeed to find a subject - or
even an object - that does not collude with the camera lens.
The only trick here, generally speaking, is to be ignorant of how one's subjects
live. This gives them a certain aura of mystery, a savagery, which the success­
ful picture captures. It also captures a gleam of ingenuity, of fatality, in their
faces, betraying the fact that they do not know who they are or how they live. A
glow of impotence and awe that is completely lacking in our tribes of worldly,
devious, fashion-conscious and self-regarding people, always well-versed in
the subject of themselves - and hence devoid of all mystery. For such people
the camera is merciless.
The only genuinely photographic subjects are those which are violated, taken
by surprise, discovered or exposed despite themselves, those which should
never have been represented because they have neither self-image nor self­
consciousness. The savage - like the savage part of us - has no reflection. He is
savagely foreign to himself. The most seductive women are the most self­
estranged (Marilyn) . Good photography does not represent anything: rather, it
captures this non-representability, the otherness of that which is foreign to
itself (to desire, to self-consciousness), the radical exoticism of the object.
Objects, like primitives, are way ahead of us in the photogenic stakes: they are
free a priori of psychology and introspection, and hence retain all their
seductive power before the camera.
Photography records the state of the world in our absence. The lens
explores this absence; and it does so even in bodies and faces laden with
emotion, with pathos. Consequently, the best photographs are photographs of
beings for which the other does not exist, or no longer exists (primitives, the

poor, objects) . Only the non-human is photogenic. Only when this precondi­
tion is met does a kind of reciprocal wonder come into play - and hence a
collusiveness on our part vis-a-vis the world, and a collusiveness on the part of
the world with respect to us.
Photography is our exorcism. Primitive society had its masks, bourgeois
society its mirrors, and we have our images.
We believe that we bend the world to our will by means of technology. In
fact it is the world that imposes its will upon us with the aid of technology, and
the surprise occasioned by this turning of the tables is considerable.
You think you are photographing a scene for the pleasure of it, but in fact it
is the scene that demands to be photographed, and you are merely part of the decor
in the pictorial order it dictates. The subject is no more than the funnel through
which things in their irony make their appearance. The image is the ideal
medium for the vast self-promotion campaign undertaken by the world and by
objects - forcing our imagination into self-effacement, our passions into
extraversion, and shattering the mirror which we hold out (hypocritically,
moreover) in order to capture them.
The miraculous thing about the present period is that appearances, so long
reduced to a voluntary servitude, have now become sovereign, and turned
back towards (and against) us by means of the very technology from which we
had earlier evicted them. Today they come from elsewhere, from their own
place, from the heart of their banality, of their objectality: they surge forth on
all sides, multiplying of their own accord, and joyfully. (The joy of taking
photographs is an objective joy, and anyone who has never felt the objective
transports of the image, some morning, in some town or desert, will never
understand the pataphysical delicacy of the world.)
If a thing wants to be photographed, this is precisely because it does not
want to offer up its meaning, because it does not want to have a reflection. It
wants to be apprehended directly, violated on the spot, illuminated in detail

under its fractal aspect. One can tell that a thing wants to be photographed,
that it wants to become an image, and it is certainly not because it wants to
endure: on the contrary, it wants to disappear. The human subject is a good
photographic medium, moreover, only if he enters into the spirit of this game,
if he suspends his own gaze and his own aesthetic judgement, if he takes
pleasure in his own absence .
A photographic image must have this quality of a universe from which the
subject has withdrawn. The very detail of the object, of line and light, should
signify this suspension of the subject, and hence also of the world, which is
what creates the photograph's tension. By means of the image the world
imposes its discontinuity, its fragmentation, its distension, its artificial instan­
taneousness. From this standpoint the photograph is the purest of images, for
it simulates neither time nor motion and is thus unrealistic in the strictest
sense. All other kinds of images (cinema, etc.), far from being advances, are
perhaps merely less thoroughgoing forms of that divorce of the pure image
from reality. The intensity of the image is proportional to its discreteness and
maximal abstraction - that is, to its bias towards the denial of reality. Creating
an image consists in stripping the object of all its features one by one: weight,
outline, feel, depth, time, continuity - and, of course, meaning. Only thanks to
this disincarnation, to this exorcism, does the image acquire its extra fascina­
tion, its intensity; only thus does it become the conduit of pure objectality,
permeable to a subtler kind of seduction. Restoring all these dimensions one
after the other - outline, motion, emotion, idea, pathos, meaning, desire - as a
way of doing better, of getting closer to reality (i.e. merely improved simula­
tion) is a total nonsense where images are concerned. This is where technology
falls into its own trap.
In photography, things are linked by a technical operation that corresponds to
the way in which they are linked in their everyday banality. The fatal attraction
of the object as perennial detail. The magical excentricity of the detail. What is
154

an image for another image, a photo for another photo? Fractal contiguity, the
absence of any dialectic: no 'world-view', no gaze - just the refraction of the
world, of the world in its details, each with an equal chance.
The photographic image is dramatic. Dramatic by virtue of its silence .
Dramatic by virtue of its immobility. What things dream of, what we dream of,
is not motion but this more intense immobility. The force of the unmoving
image: the force of the mythic opera. Even the cinema cultivates the myth of
slow motion and the freeze-frame as moments of highest drama. And the
paradoxical contribution of television may turn out to be the restoration of all
its charm to the silence of the image.
The photographic image is dramatic, too, on account of the struggle it
embodies between the subject's will to impose an order, a vision, and the
object' s will to impose itself in its discreteness and immediacy. If all goes well
the object carries the day, for the photo-image is the image of a fractal world for
which no formula, no summary, exists anywhere. In this it differs from art,
from painting, even from the cinema - all of which inevitably strive, thanks to a
concept, a vision or an internal movement, to limn the figure of a totality.
Not, then, the subject's detachment with respect to the world, but the
disconnectedness of objects amongst themselves, the haphazard sequence of
part-objects and details. Musical syncopation, or the motion of physical
particles. Photography brings us closer than anything else to the fly, with its
faceted eye and the broken line of its flight.
Perhaps the desire to take photographs arises from the observation that on
the broadest view, from the standpoint of reason, the world is a great
disappointment. In its details, however, and caught by surprise, the world
always has a stunning clarity.
The secret form of the Other is what has to be reconstituted, as in
anamorphosis, starting with the fragments and tracing its broken lines, its lines
of fracture.

PURSUIT IN VENICE

A strange pride incites us not only to possess the other but also to force the
other's secret out of him, not only to be dear to the other but also to be fatal to
him. To play the eminence grise in the other's life.
You begin by following people at random, in the street, in short unorga­
nized bursts, with the notion that people's lives are haphazard itineraries
without meaning, heading nowhere - and fascinating for that very reason. You
feel that you exist only when you are on their track - without their knowing it;
in fact you are tracking yourself - without your knowing it. You are not really
doing this, then, to discover how the other lives, nor where he is going; nor are
you drifting in search of the unknown. Rather, you are allowing yourself to be
seduced by being the other's mirror without his knowledge. By becoming his
destiny, by repeating his itinerary - which, though it has a meaning for him,
has none when you duplicate it. It is as though someone, behind him, knew
that he was going nowhere. In a way, his goal has thus been stolen from him:
an evil genie has slipped surreptitiously between him and his self. This effect

is so powerful that people often sense that they are being followed; they have
an intuition that something has entered their space and altered its geometry.
In Sophie Calle's La Suite venitienne, S. decides one day to give an extra
dimension to this experiment by following a man she barely knows throughout
a trip he is making to Venice . She manages to locate the hotel where he is
staying. She rents a room opposite so that she can observe his comings and
goings. She photographs him continually. She wants nothing from him, has no
desire to know him. Since he might recognize her, she disguises herself as a
blonde. But Carnival holds no attraction for her, and she spends a fortnight
surmounting endless difficulties in order to keep on the trail of her prey. She
questions people in the shops he visits, she knows which shows he goes to .
She even knows the exact time of his return to Paris, and goes to await his
arrival so that she can take a last snapshot of him.
Does she want him to kill her? Does she want him to find her pursuit so
intolerable (especially since she wants nothing out of it, least of all romance)
that he will attack her physically or tum on her, like Orpheus on Eurydice, and
make her disappear? Is she hoping that things will suddenly be reversed and
that he will become her destiny? Like all games, this one too has its fundamental
rule: nothing must happen that might facilitate a contact or a relationship
between them. The secret must not be revealed, for fear of falling into banality.
Obviously there is something lethal here for the one who is being followed,
and who must consequently try to wipe out his tracks as fast as he makes them.
For one can no more live without leaving tracks than one can without casting a
shadow. S., as his eminence grise, is stealing his tracks, and he cannot fail to
sense the magic to which he is being subjected. He is being photographed
incessantly. The photograph here has neither a voyeuristic nor an archival
function. Its simple message has the form: at this location, at such and such a
time, in this particular light, someone was present. But at the same time it
conveys the following: there was no point in being here, in such and such a

157

place, and at such and such a time - and in fact no one was here; I was the one
who followed him, and I can assure you that no one was here.
It is of no interest to know that someone is leading a double life. It is the
tailing itself that supplies the other with a double life. The most ordinary of lives may
be transfigured in this way; likewise, the most extraordinary of lives may be
rendered trite. In any case, life thus succumbs to a strange attraction.
We should not say 'The other exists, I have met him', but instead 'The other
exists, I have followed him' . Meeting, confrontation, is always too real, too
direct, too indiscreet. There is no secret involved. Think how people meeting
each other are forever recognizing each other, forever reciting their identities
Gust as people who love each other are forever telling each other so). Can they
be so sure of themselves? Does encountering the other really prove that he
exists? Nothing could be more doubtful. On the other hand, if I follow the other
secretly, he exists - precisely because I do not know him, because I do not want
to know him, nor to have him recognize me . He exists because, without having
chosen to, I exercise a deadly right over him: the right to follow. Without ever
having approached him, I know him better than anyone. I can even leave him ­
as S. does in La Suite venitienne with the certitude that I shall find him again
tomorrow in the labyrinth of the city in accordance with a sort of astral
conjunction (because the city is curved, because space is curved, because the
rules of the game inevitably put the two protagonists back on the same orbit) .
The only way to avoid encountering someone is to follow him (according to
a principle opposed to the principle of the labyrinth, where you follow
someone so that you do not lose him) . Implicit in the situation, however, is the
dramatic moment when the one being followed, suddenly intuiting, suddenly
becoming conscious that there is someone behind him, swings round and
spots his pursuer. Then the rules are reversed, and the hunter becomes the
hunted (for there is no escaping laterally) . The only truly dramatic point is this

unexpected turning-round of the other, who insists upon knowing and damns
the consequences.
This reversal does in fact occur in the Venice scenario. The man comes
towards her and asks her: 'What do you want?' She wants nothing. No
mystery story, no love story. This answer is intolerable, and implies possible
murder, possible death. Radical otherness always embodies the risk of death.
S.' s anxiety revolves entirely around this violent revelation: the possibility of
getting herself unmasked - the very thing she is trying to avoid. 'I cannot go on
following him. He must be uneasy, he must be wondering if I am here, behind
him - surely he is thinking about me now - so I shall have to keep track of him
in some other way.'
S. could have met this man, seen him, spoken to him. But in that case she
would never have produced this secret form of the existence of the Other. The
Other is the one whose destiny one becomes, not by making his acquaintance
in difference and dialogue but by entering into him as into something secret,
something forever separate. Not by engaging in a conversation with him as
interlocutor, but by entering into him as his shadow, as his double, as his
image, by embracing the Other the better to wipe out his tracks, the better to
strip him of his shadow. The Other is never the one with whom we communi­
cate: he is the one whom we follow - and who follows us.
The other is never naturally the other: the other must be rendered other by
being seduced, by being made alien to himself, even by being destroyed - if
there is no alternative (but in fact there are subtler ways of achieving this end).
Each of us lives by setting traps for the other. The one and the other live in an
endless affinity, an affinity which endures until prostration decides the issue.
Everyone wants their other. Everyone has an imperious need to put the other at
their mercy, along with a heady urge to make the other last as long as possible
so as to savour him. The opposing logics of the lie and the truth unite in a dance
of death which is nothing but pure delight at the other's demise. For desire for

the other is always also the desire to put an end to the other (albeit, perhaps, at
the latest possible moment?) . The only question is which one will hold out the
longest, occupying the space, the speech, the silence, the very inner world of
the other - who is dispossessed of himself at the very moment when he
becomes one in his difference. Not that one kills the other: the adversary is
simply harassed into desiring, into willingly acceding to his own symbolic
death . . . The world is a perfectly functioning trap .
An otherness, a foreignness, that is ultimately unintelligible - such is the
secret of the form, and the singularity, of the emergence of the other.
Yes, of course,

Ferdydurke does show how individuals

are determined by their

environment, but what for me has far deeper implications for psychology,
what is far more disturbing from a philosophical standpoint, is that on
occasion a man can be created by another man, by another himself, by virtue of
a fortuitous encounter, and at any moment . . . I am not concerned with
pointing out that a particular social milieu can impose its conventions on me,
or - as Marx would argue - that man is a product of his social class . What I want
to show is the contact a man can have with his counterpart, and the immediate,
fortuitous and wild character of this contact: to demonstrate how, on the basis
of such a haphazard relationship, forms are brought into being that are
absolutely unexpected, even absurd . . . Is it not obvious to you that a form of
this kind is something far more powerful than a mere social convention? That
this is an element which simply cannot be controlled?
(Witold Gombrowicz)

VIRAL HOSPITALITY

Each of us is the destiny of the other, and no doubt the secret destiny of each of
us is to destroy (or seduce) the other - not by virtue of a curse or some kind of
death drive, but by virtue of our own vital destination.
It is perhaps not unreasonable to conceive of the evolution of an infectious
disease within the human body by analogy with the history of a certain type of
microbe, a history complete with beginning, climax and period of decline. A
history which indeed parallels that of the human race: the dimensions differ,
naturally, but from the point of view of the idea, the two are identical.
The type of microbe in question lives in the blood, the lymph, the tissues of
a human individual. This human being, whom we think of as afflicted by
disease, is the microbe' s landscape, its world. And for these minuscule
individuals, to strive unconsciously and involuntarily to destroy this world of
theirs, and often to succeed in so doing, is the basic requirement and the entire
meaning of their existence . (Who is to say that the different members of this
race of microbes are not endowed, j ust as human individuals are, with greatly

varying talents and wills, and that there are not among their number both
ordinary microbes and geniuses?)
Might it not then be surmised that from the standpoint of some higher
organism, humanity is itself a sickness; that the existence of humanity has this
organism as prerequisite, as basic requirement, as meaning, and that we are
forever striving - indeed,

obliged

-

to destroy it progressively as we develop,

just as the microbes strive to destroy a human individual 'afflicted by disease'?
And, follOwing this line of thought, is it not reasonable to suppose that the
mission of any living community, be it a community of microbes or a commun­
ity of human beings, is to destroy, little by little, a world that transcends it,
whether that world is a human individual or our universe?
Even if this supposition were close to the truth, however, our imagination
would still be at a loss to deal with it, for the human mind can grasp only
downward, not upward, movements. We have relative knowledge only of
what is at a lower elevation; when it comes to higher realities, we are confined
to mere presentiments. We may perhaps, though, be permitted in this connec­
tion to interpret the history of humanity as an eternal struggle against the
divine, which, despite its resistance, is gradually, and of necessity, being
destroyed by the human. By extension we may speculate that this transcend­
ent principle, which seems to us - or which we sense as - divine, is itself in turn
transcended by another, even higher, principle, and so on

ad infinitum.

(Arthur Schnitzler)

Between the race of microbes and the race of humans there exists a total
symbiosis and a radical incompatibility. One cannot say that the microbe is
other to man: the two are never opposed in their essential natures, and they do
not confront one another in any real sense; they are linked together, however,
and this interlinking is, as it were, predestined: no one (neither men nor bacilli)
can imagine things being any other way. Nor is there any clear line of
demarcation, because this link is reproduced over and over ad infinitum. So
perhaps after all we shall have to conclude that otherness is located here: that

the absolute Other is indeed the microbe in its radical non-humanness - a
being of which we know nothing, and which cannot even be deemed d ifferent
from us. The microbe as the hidden form which alters everything - and with
which no negotiation or reconciliation is possible. Yet we are quickened by the
same life as the microbe, and the race of microbes will perish along with the
human race: we share the same destiny. One is reminded of the worm that has
a sort of alga living in its stomach, without whose help it can digest no food.
This is a fine arrangement until the day the worm takes a notion to devour the
alga itself. And it does so - but dies as a result (without even digesting it, of
course, because the alga is no longer there to help it to do so).

1 63

THE DECLINATION OF

WILLS

The secret of the other i s that i t is never given t o m e to b e myself, and that I exist
only thanks to a fatal declination of something coming from elsewhere. In
Schnitzler's apologia, man lives off the life of the species of microbe that has
colonized him and is destined to destroy him: man and microbe are strangers
to one another, but their destiny is shared. In La Suite venitienne, S. does not
know either what she is or where she is going: she follows someone who is
going somewhere, and shares his secret without knowing it. It is thus always
by virtue of a declination of meaning, or of non-meaning, that existence takes
on form - by virtue, that is, of the deflection of something else. We have no will
of our own, and the other is never what we would, of our own volition, choose
to confront. Rather, the other is an invasion by something from elsewhere,
priority given to what comes from elsewhere, seduction by foreignness and the
transmission of foreignness.
So the secret of philosophy may not be to know oneself, nor to know where
one is going, but rather to go where the other is going; not to dream oneself,
but rather to dream what others dream; not to believe oneself, but rather to

184

believe in those who do believe : to give priority to all determinants from
elsewhere. Whether they are legible or not, decipherable or not, is of no
consequence - the main thing is to embrace the foreign form of any event, any
object, any fortuitous being, because in any case you will never know who you
are. Today, when people have lost their shadows, it is of the utmost importance
to be followed by someone; today, when everyone is losing their own tracks, it
is of the utmost urgency that someone be on your tracks: even if he wipes them
out and makes you disappear as a result, at least your disappearance will have
occurred in a collusive mode; at least a symbolic form of obligation, an
enigmatic form of conjunction and disjunction, will have been brought into
play.
We live in a culture which strives to return to each of us full responsibility
for his own life. The moral responsibility inherited from the Christian tradition
has thus been augmented, with the help of the whole modern apparatus of
information and communication, by the requirement that everyone should be
answerable for every aspect of their lives . What this amounts to is an expulsion
of the other, who has indeed become perfectly useless in the context of a
programmed management of life, a regimen where everything conspires to
buttress the autarky of the individual cell.
This, however, is an absurdity: no one can be expected to be entirely
responsible for his own life. This Christian-cum-modern idea is futile and
arrogant. It is also a utopian notion with no justification whatsoever. It requires
that the individual should transform himself into a slave to his identity, his
will, his responsibilities, his desire; and that he should start exercising control
of all his own circuitry, as well as all the worldwide circuits that happen to
cross paths within his genes, nerves or thought: a truly unheard-of servitude.
How much more human to place one's fate, one's desire and one's will in
the hands of someone else. The result? A circulation of responsibility, a
declination of wills, and a continual transferring of forms.

Inasmuch as my life is played out within the other, it becomes a mystery to
itself. Inasmuch as my will is transferred to the other, it too becomes a mystery
to itself.
There is always some doubt about the reality of our pleasure, about the
strength of our will. Curiously, though we are never completely certain, the
other's pleasure somehow seems less doubtful. Being closer to our own
pleasure, we are better placed to cast doubt on it. To argue that everyone is
inclined to give too much credit to his own opinion is to underestimate the
contrary tendency: the subordination of one's own opinion to that of other
people supposedly better equipped to hold opinions (this is rather like the
Chinese erotic practice of postponing one's own pleasure to ensure that of the
other, thus saving energy and gaining deeper knowledge) . The hypothesis of
the Other itself may perhaps be the consequence of this radical doubt of ours
with respect to our own desire.
If it is true that seduction is founded upon my intuition of something in the
other that remains forever secret for him, something that I can never know
directly about him but which nevertheless exercises a fascination upon me
from behind its veil of secrecy, then today there can be very little leeway left for
seduction, for the other retains very little mystery for himself. The fact is that
everyone is devilishly self-aware these days, devilishly conscious of the nature
of their own desire. Everything is now so clear that the very fact of presenting
oneself behind a mask is liable to elicit nothing but mockery. In such a context,
what becomes of the poker game of seduction? Where, for that matter, is the
illusion of desire - except, perhaps, in the theoretical illusion of psychoanalysis
or the political illusion of revolution?
One may be no longer capable of belief, yet remain capable of believing in those
who believe. One may be no longer capable of loving, except for loving

someone who loves. One may no longer know what one wants, yet want what
someone else wants. A kind of generalized derogation is occurring, whereby
wish, ability and knowledge, though not forsaken, are being surrendered to
another, a second agency. Already, in any case, the filter of screens, photo­
graphs, video images and news reporting allows us access only to that which
has already been seen by others. We are indeed incapable of apprehending
anything that has not already been seen. We have assigned machines the task
of seeing for us - just as, before long, we shall assign computers the task of
making all our decisions. All our functions, even organic and sensory ones, are
relayed by satellite. A comparison may even be drawn with the mental division
of pleasure: just as desire is not need, so pleasure is not satisfaction. Desire and
pleasure repose on need and satisfaction, which are strategies of the above­
mentioned second agency.
At all events, it is better to be controlled by someone else than by oneself. Better
to be oppressed, exploited, persecuted and manipulated by someone other
than by oneself.
In this sense the entire movement for liberation and emancipation, inas­
much as it is predicated on a demand for greater autonomy - or, in other
words, on a more complete introjection of all forms of control and constraint
under the banner of freedom - is a regression. Whatever it may be that comes
to us from elsewhere, even the worst exploitation, the very fact that it comes
from somewhere else is positive. This is why alienation has its advantages,
even though it is so often denounced as the dispossession of the self, with the
other treated in consequence as an age-old enemy holding the alienated part of
us captive. The inverse theory, that of disalienation, is equally simplistic,
holding as it does that the subject merely has to reappropriate his alienated will
and his alienated desire. From this perspective everything that befalls the
subject as a result of his own efforts is good, because it is authentic; while

everything that comes from outside the subject is dubbed inauthentic, merely
because it does not fall within the sphere of his freedom.
Exactly the opposite position is the one that has to be stressed, while at the
same time broadening the paradox. For just as it is better to be controlled by
someone else rather than by oneself, it is likewise always better to be made
happy, or unhappy, by someone else rather than by oneself. It is always better
to depend in life on something that does not depend on us. In this way I can
avoid any kind of servitude. I am not obliged to submit to something that does
not depend on me - including my own existence. I am free of my birth - and in
the same sense I can be free of my death. There has never been any true
freedom apart from this one. The source of all interplay, of everything that is in
play, of all passion, of all seduction, is that which is completely foreign to us,
yet has power over us. That which is Other, that which we have to seduce.
An ethic founded on the transmission of foreignness implies a philosophy of
subtlety. Subtlety as the most basic form of artifice: the subtlety whereby we
live not on our own energy or according to our own will but rather thanks to
the energy and the will that we subtly spirit away from others, from the world,
from those whom we love or those whom we hate . We live on a surreptitiously
obtained energy, a purloined energy, an energy seduced away from others.
The other too, meanwhile, can exist only by means of this subtle and indirect
play of capture, seduction and transmission. Placing oneself in the hands of
another with respect to will, belief, love or choice is not an abdication but a
strategy. In letting your destiny be defined by the other, you draw off the
subtlest of energies. By putting some sign or event in charge of your life, you
subtly annex the form of that sign or event.
A strategy of this kind is far from innocent. It is the strategy adopted by
children. Whereas adults make children believe that they, the adults, are
adults, children for their part let adults believe that they, the children, are
children. Of these two strategies the second is the subtler, for while adults

believe that they are adults, children do not believe that they are children. They
children, but they do not believe it. They sail under the flag of childhood as
under a flag of convenience. The ruse (and the seduction) is total. Children are
not far removed, in fact, from Schnitzler's microbes: they are, as it were, a
different species, and their vitality and development announce the eventual
destruction of the superior - adult - world that surrounds them. Childhood
haunts the adult universe as a subtle and deadly presence. It is in this sense
that the child is other to the adult: the child is the adult's destiny, the adult is
his most subtly distilled form. The child nevertheless repudiates the adult - all
the while moving within him with all the grace of those who have no will of
their own.
Likewise with the masses, who voyage under this appellation as though in
compliance with a destiny of convenience. They too have grown up - in the
obscurity of the political realm - as a strange, hostile and unintelligible species
whose spontaneous virulence is liable to destroy any political order. They too
are the other for authority: a blind protagonist haunting the political labyrinth
- that which power cannot know, cannot name, cannot point to. That the
masses are able to exert their own subtle power to alter things is due to the fact
that they use the same unconscious strategy of letting others want, letting
others believe. They themselves are in no danger of believing in their own
status as 'masses' : since subjectivity and speech are forbidden to them, they
have never gone through the political mirror stage. This clearly distinguishes
them from the political class, all the members of which believe in - or at least
pretend to believe in - the excellence of the said masses. The cynicism of these
politicians could never remotely rival the objective cynicism of the masses
themselves with regard to their own (non-existent) essence.
The masses thus enjoy a long lead here, for the others believe that they, the
masses, are alienated - and the masses let them believe it. The feminine
principle also partakes of this 'lascivious' irony, as when women let men
believe that they are men, while they themselves, secretly, do not believe that
are

they are women (any more than children believe that they are children). One
who lets others believe is always superior to one who believes, or makes others
believe. The idea of the sexual and political liberation of women was a trap
precisely in that it made women believe that they were women. Consequently,
the ideology of femininity triumphed: the rights of women, the status of
women, the idea of women - all these carried the day, along with the belief in
women's own essential nature. Once women are thus 'liberated', once they
want to be women, the superior irony of the community of women is perforce
lost. No one is immune from this kind of misadventure. Think how men, by
taking themselves for free men, have fallen into voluntary servitude.
The man I am proposing is created externally; he is inauthentic in his very
essence, for he is never himself and he is defined by a form which comes into
being between men . Man is the eternal actor, certainly, but he is also a natural
actor, in the sense that his artifice is congenital - this being, indeed, one of his
defining human characteristics . . . To be a man means to be an actor, to be a
man means to simulate man, to behave like a man, while not being a man deep
down: this sums up humanity . . . It is not a matter of urging man to cast aside
his mask (behind which there is in any case no face), but what one can ask of
man is that he should become aware of his artificial state, and confess it.
If I am condemned to artifice . . .
If it is not given to me to be myself . . .

(Gombrowicz)

Simulating a man, not being oneself, calls for a great deal of affectation. A
subtle way of regulating one's fate on the basis of external, 'inauthentic' signs,
affectation is condemned by our entire culture, which is a culture of truth and
sincerity. Affectation is that affective state in which one becomes aware, as
Gombrowicz puts it, of the artificiality of one's condition; in this state we create
a kind of artificial double for ourselves, an artificial shadow into which we

enter, an artificial automaton produced from our own essence - the means, in
short, to externalize ourselves, thanks to signs, as other.
Does not great affectation in fact characterize all our automata, all our
artificial machines, all our techniques? Andy Warhol has found the formula of
maximum snobbery here: 'I want to be a machine'. By assigning himself, as a
unique machine, to the realm of machines and machine-made objects, by
employing just a touch more simulation and artificiality, Warhol out­
manoeuvres the very machinations of this system. Whereas an ordinary
machine produces objects, Warhol produces the object's secret aim - which
is to be reproduced. He reproduces the object complete with its ultra-purpose,
cloaked in the secret non-sense that emanates from the very process of object­
generation. Where others seek to add a little soul, Warhol adds a little more
machinery. Where others seek a little more meaning, he seeks a little more
artifice. Less and less himself, more and more affected, he reaches the
machine's magical core by reproducing the world in all its trite exactness. Less
and less the subject of desire - closer and closer to the nothingness of the
object.

THE OBJECT AS STRANGE
ATTRACTOR

In the end, all figures of otherness boil down to just one : that of the Object. In
the end, all that is left is the inexorability of the Object, the irredeemability of
the Object.
Even at the outer frontiers of science the Object appears ever more
ungraspable : it remains internally indivisible and hence unanalysable, infin­
itely versatile, reversible, ironic, and contemptuous of all attempts to manipu­
late it. The subject tries desperately to follow it, even at the cost of abandoning
scientific principles, but the Object transcends even the sacrifice of scientific
rationality. The Object is an insoluble enigma, because it is not itself and does
not know itself. It resembles Chesterton's savage, whom one could not
understand for the same reason that he could not understand himself. It thus
constitutes an obstacle to all understanding. The Object'S power and sover­
eignty derive from the fact that it is estranged from itself, whereas for us the
exact opposite is true. Civilization's first gesture is to hold up a mirror to the
Object, but the Object is only seemingly reflected therein; in fact it is the Object

itself which is the mirror, and it is here that the subject is taken in by the illusion
of himself.
So where is science's 'other'? Where is its object? Science has lost its
interlocutor, which, like the 'savage', appears not to have responded with
genuine dialogue. It seems that it is not a good object, that it does not respect
'difference', that it secretly evades all attempts at scientific evangelization
(rational objectification), and that it is taking its revenge for having been
'understood' by surreptitiously undermining the foundations of the edifice of
science. The diabolical pursuit-race of the Object and the subject of science is
an event worth following.
All

that remains is the Object as a strange attractor. The subject is no longer a
strange attractor. We know the subject too well; the subject knows himself too
well. It is the Object that is exciting, because the Object is my vanishing point.
The Object is what theory can be for reality: not a reflection but a challenge,
and a strange attractor. This, potentially, is the way to go in search of
otherness.
There are two methods of getting beyond alienation. Either disalienation
and the reappropriation of oneself - a tiresome process, without much pros­
pect of success these days. Or the other extreme - the path of the absolute
Other, of absolute exoticism. This alternative path leads to an exponential
defined elsewhere, virtually, in terms of total excentricity. It goes beyond
alienation but in the same direction - to what is more other than the Other, to
radical otherness.
The duality of otherness implies an unchallengeable metamorphosis, an
unchallengeable supremacy of appearances and metamorphoses . I am not
alienated. Rather, I am definitively other. No longer subject to the law of desire,
but subject now to the total artifice of rules. I have lost any trace of desire of my
own. I answer only to something non-human - something inscribed not within
me but solely in the objective and arbitrary vicissitudes of the world's signs.

Just as what we deem fatal in catastrophes is the world's sovereign indifference
to us, so what we deem fatal in seduction is the Other's sovereign otherness
with respect to us. That otherness which erupts into our life, with stunning
clarity, in the shape of a gesture, a face, a form, a word, a prophetic dream, a
witticism, an object, a woman, or a desert.
This other, when it makes its appearance, is immediately in possession of
everything that it will never be given to us to know. This other is the locus of
our secret, of everything in us that no longer belongs to the realm of the true.
This other is thus not, as in love, the locus of our alikeness, nor, as in alienation,
the locus of our difference; neither the ideal image of what we are nor the
obscure model of what we lack. Rather, this other is the locus of what escapes
us, and the way whereby we escape from ourselves. The other here is not the
locus of desire, not the locus of alienation, but the locus of vertiginousness, of
eclipse, of appearing and disappearing - the locus, one might say (but we must
not), of the scintillation of being. For the rule of seduction is, precisely, secrecy,
and the secret in question is that of the fundamental rule.
Seduction knows that the other is never the end of desire, that the subject
is mistaken when he focuses on what he loves, just as an utterance is mistaken
when it focuses on what it says. Secrecy here is always the secrecy of artifice.
The necessity of always focusing somewhere else, of never seeking the other in
the terrifying illusion of dialogue but instead following the other like the
other' s own shadow, and circumscribing him. Never being oneself - but never
being alienated either: coming from without to inscribe oneself upon the figure
of the Other, within that strange form from elsewhere, that secret form which
orders not only chains of events but also existences in their singularity.
The Other is what allows me not to repeat myself for ever.

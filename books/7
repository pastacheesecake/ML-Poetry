INTRODUCTION

A WEB OF BRANDS

If I squint, tilt my head, and shut my left eye, all I can see out the window is 1932, straight down to
the lake. Brown warehouses, oatmeal-colored smokestacks, faded signs painted on brick walls
advertising long-discontinued brands: "Lovely," "Gaywear." This is the old industrial Toronto of
garment factories, furriers and wholesale wedding dresses. So far, no one has come up with a way
to make a profit out of taking a wrecking ball to these boxes of brick, and in this little eight- or
nine-block radius, the modern city has been layered haphazardly on top of the old.
I wrote this book while living in Toronto's ghost of a garment district in a ten-story warehouse.
Many other buildings like it have long since been boarded up, glass panes shattered, smokestacks
holding their breath; their only remaining capitalist function is to hoist large blinking billboards on
their tar-coated roofs, reminding the gridlocked drivers on the lakeshore expressway of the
existence of Molson's beer, Hyundai cars and EZ Rock FM.
In the twenties and thirties, Russian and Polish immigrants darted back and forth on these streets,
ducking into delis to argue about Trotsky and the leadership of the International Ladies' Garment
Workers' Union. These days, old Portuguese men still push racks of dresses and coats down the
sidewalk, and next door you can still buy a rhinestone bridal tiara if the need for such an item
happens to arise (a Halloween costume, or perhaps a school play...). The real action, however, is
down the block amid the stacks of edible jewellery at Sugar Mountain, the retro candy Mecca, open
until 2 a.m. to service the late-night ironic cravings of the club kids. And a store downstairs
continues to do a modest trade in bald naked mannequins, though more often than not it's rented out
as the surreal set for a film school project or the tragically hip backdrop of a television interview.

The layering of decades on Spadina Avenue, like so many urban neighbourhoods in a similar state
of post-industrial limbo, has a wonderful accidental charm to it. The lofts and studios are full of
people who know they are playing their part in a piece of urban performance art, but for the most
part, they do their best not to draw attention to that fact. If anyone claims too much ownership over
"the real Spadina," then everyone else starts feeling like a two-bit prop, and the whole edifice
crumbles.
Which is why it was so unfortunate that City Hall saw fit to commission a series of public art
installations to “celebrate” the history of Spadina Avenue? First came the steel figures perched atop
the lampposts: women hunched over sewing machines and crowds of striking workers waving
placards with indecipherable slogans. Then the worst happened: the giant brass thimble arrived right at the corner of my block. There it was: eleven and a half feet high and eleven feet across.
Two giant pastel buttons were plopped on the sidewalk next to it, with wimpy little saplings
growing out of the holes. Thank goodness Emma Goldman, the famed anarchist and labour
organizer who lived on this street in the late 1930s, wasn't around to witness the transformation of
the garment workers' struggle into sweatshop kitsch.
The thimble is only the most overt manifestation of a painful new self-consciousness on the grid.
All around me, the old factory buildings are being rezoned and converted into "loft-living"
complexes with names like "The Candy Factory." The hand-me-downs of industrialization have
already been mined for witty fashion ideas - discarded factory workers' uniforms, Diesel's Labour
brand jeans and Caterpillar boots. So of course there is also a booming market for condos in
second-hand sweatshops, luxuriously reno-ed, with soaking tubs, slate-lined showers, underground
parking, sky lit gymnasiums and twenty-four-hour concierges.
So far my landlord, who made his fortune manufacturing and selling London Fog overcoats, has
stubbornly refused to sell off our building as condominiums with exceptionally high ceilings. He'll
relent eventually, but for now he still has a handful of garment tenants left, whose businesses are
too small to move to Asia or Central America and who for whatever reason are unwilling to follow
the industry trend toward home workers paid by the piece. The rest of the building is rented out to
yoga instructors, documentary film producers, graphic designers and writers and artists with
live/work spaces. The shmata guys still selling coats in the office next door look terribly dismayed
when they see the Marilyn Manson clones stomping down the hall in chains and thigh-high leather
boots to the communal washroom, clutching tubes of toothpaste, but what can they do? We are all
stuck together here for now, caught between the harsh realities of economic globalization and the
all-enduring rock-video aesthetic.
JAKARTA —"Ask her what she makes-what it says on the label. You know-label?" I said,
reaching behind my head and twisting up the collar of my shirt. By now these Indonesian workers
were used to people like me: foreigners who come to talk to them about the abysmal conditions in
the factories where they cut, sew and glue for multinational companies like Nike, the Gap and Liz
Claiborne. But these seamstresses looked nothing like the elderly garment workers I meet in the
elevator back home. Here they were all young, some of them as young as fifteen; only a few were
over twenty-one.

On this particular day in August 1997, the abysmal conditions in question had led to a strike at the
Kaho Indah Citra garment factory on the outskirts of Jakarta in the Kawasan Berikat IMusantar
industrial zone. The issue for the Kaho workers, who earn the equivalent of US$2 per day, was that
they were being forced to work long hours of overtime but weren't being paid at the legal rate for
their trouble. After a three-day walkout, management offered a compromise typical of a region with
a markedly relaxed relationship to labour legislation: overtime would no longer be compulsory but
the compensation would remain illegally low. The 2,000 workers returned to their sewing
machines; all except 101 young women who-management decided—were the troublemakers behind
the strike. "Until now our case is still not settled," one of these workers told me, bursting with
frustration and with no recourse in sight.
I was sympathetic, of course, but, being the Western foreigner, I wanted to know what brand of
garments they produced at the Kaho factory - if I was to bring their story home, I would have to
have my journalistic hook. So here we were, ten of us, crowded into a concrete bunker only slightly
bigger than a telephone booth, playing an enthusiastic round of labour charades.
"This company produces long sleeves for cold seasons," one worker offered.
I guessed: "Sweaters?"
"I think not sweaters. If you prepare to go out and you have a cold season you have a..."
I got it: "Coat!"
"But not heavy. Light."
"Jackets!"
"Yes, like jackets, but not jackets-long."
You can understand the confusion: there isn't much need for overcoats on the equator, not in the
closet and not in the vocabulary. And yet increasingly, Canadians get through their cold winters not
with clothing manufactured by the tenacious seamstresses still on Spadina Avenue but by young
Asian women working in hot climates like this one. In 1997, Canada imported $11.7 million of
anoraks and ski jackets from Indonesia, up from $4.7 million in 1993.' That much I knew already.
But I still didn't know what brand of long coats the Kaho workers sewed before they lost their jobs.
"Long, yes. And what's on the label?" I asked again.
There was a bit of hushed consultation, and then, finally, an answer: "London Fog."
A global coincidence, I suppose. I started to tell the Kaho workers that my apartment in Toronto
used to be a London Fog coat factory but stopped abruptly when it became clear from their facial
expressions that the idea of anyone choosing to live in a garment building was nothing but
alarming. In this part of the world, hundreds of workers every year burn to death because their
dormitories are located upstairs from firetrap sweatshops.

Sitting cross-legged on the concrete floor of the tiny dorm room, I thought of my neighbours back
home: the Ashtanga yoga instructor on two, the commercial animators on four and the
aromatherapy candle distributors on eight. It seems the young women in the export processing zone
are our roommates of sorts, connected, as is so often the case, by a web of fabrics, shoelaces,
franchises, teddy bears and brand names wrapped around the planet. Another logo we had in
common was Esprit, also one of the brands manufactured in the zone. As a teenager I worked as a
clerk in a store that sold Esprit clothes.
And of course, McDonald's: an outlet had just opened near Kaho, frustrating workers, because this
so-called bargain food was squarely out of their price range.
Usually, reports about this global web of logos and products are couched in the euphoric marketing
rhetoric of the global village, an incredible place where tribes people in remotest rain forests tap
away on laptop computers, Sicilian grandmothers conduct E-business, and "global teens" share, to
borrow a phrase from a Levi's Web site, "a world-wide style culture." Everyone from Coke to
McDonald's to Motorola has tailored their marketing strategy around this post-national vision, but it
is IBM's long-running "Solutions for a Small Planet" campaign that most eloquently captures the
equalizing promise of the logo-linked globe.
It hasn't taken long for the excitement inspired by these manic renditions of globalization to wear
thin, revealing the cracks and fissures beneath its high-gloss facade. More and more over the past
four years, we in the West have been catching glimpses of another kind of global village, where the
economic divide is widening and cultural choices narrowing.
This is a village where some multinationals, far from levelling the global playing field with jobs
and technology for all, are in the process of mining the planet's poorest back country for
unimaginable profits. This is the village where Bill Gates lives, amassing a fortune of $55 billion
while a third of his workforce is classified as temporary workers, and where competitors are either
incorporated into the Microsoft monolith or made obsolete by the latest feat in software bundling.
This is the village where we are indeed connected to one another through a web of brands, but the
underside of that web reveals designer slums like the one I visited outside Jakarta. IBM claims that
its technology spans the globe, and so it does, but often its international presence takes the form of
cheap Third World labour producing the computer chips and power sources that drive our
machines. On the outskirts of Manila, for instance, I met a seventeen-year-old girl who assembles
CD-ROM drives for IBM. I told her I was impressed that someone so young could do such hightech work. "We make computers," she told me, "but we don't know how to operate computers."
Ours, it would seem, is not such a small planet after all.
It would be naive to believe that Western consumers haven't profited from these global divisions
since the earliest days of colonialism. The Third World, as they say, has always existed for the
comfort of the First. What is a relatively new development, however, is the amount of investigative
interest there seems to be in the unbranded points of origin of brand-name goods. The travels of
Nike sneakers have been traced back to the abusive sweatshops of Vietnam, Barbie's little outfits
back to the child labourers of Sumatra, Starbucks' lattes to the sun-scorched coffee fields of
Guatemala, and Shell's oil back to the polluted and impoverished villages of the Niger Delta.

The title No Logo is not meant to be read as a literal slogan (as in No More Logos!), or a post-logo
logo (there is already a No Logo clothing line, or so I'm told). Rather, it is an attempt to capture an
Anticorporate attitude I see emerging among many young activists. This book is hinged on a simple
hypothesis: that as more people discover the brand-name secrets of the global logo web, their
outrage will fuel the next big political movement, a vast wave of opposition squarely targeting
transnational corporations, particularly those with very high name-brand recognition.
I must stress, however, that this is not a book of predictions, but of firsthand observation. It is an
examination of a largely underground system of information, protest and planning, a system already
coursing with activity and ideas crossing many national borders and several generations.
Four years ago, when I started to write this book, my hypothesis was mostly based on a hunch. I
had been doing some research on university campuses and had begun to notice that many of the
students I was meeting were preoccupied with the inroads private corporations were making into
their public schools. They were angry that ads were creeping into cafeterias, common rooms, even
washrooms; that their schools were diving into exclusive distribution deals with soft-drink
companies and computer manufacturers, and that academic studies were starting to look more and
more like market research.
They worried that their education was suffering, as institutional priority shifted to those programs
most conducive to private-sector partnership. They also had serious ethical concerns about the
practices of some of the corporations that their schools were becoming entangled with — not so
much their
On-campus activities, but their practices far away, in countries like Burma, Indonesia and Nigeria.
It had only been a few years since I left university myself, so I knew this was a rather sudden
change in political focus; five years earlier, campus politics was all about issues of discrimination
and identity — race, gender and sexuality, "the political correctness wars." Now they were
broadening out to include corporate power, labour rights, and a fairly developed analysis of the
workings of the global economy. It's true that these students do not make up the majority of their
demographic group — in fact; this movement is coming, as all such movements do, from a
minority, but it is an increasingly powerful minority. Simply put, anticorporatism is the brand of
politics capturing the imagination of the next generation of troublemakers and shit-disturbers, and
we need only look to the student radicals of the 1960s and the ID warriors of the eighties and
nineties to see the transformative impact such a shift can have.
At around the same time, in my reporting for magazines and newspapers, I also started noticing
similar ideas at the centre of a wave of recent social and environmental campaigns. Like the campus
activists I was meeting, the people leading these campaigns were focused on the effects of
aggressive corporate sponsorships and retailing on public space and cultural life, both globally and
locally. There were small-town wars being waged all over North America to keep out the "big-box"
retailers like Wal-Mart. There was the McLibel Trial in London, a case of two British
environmentalists who turned a libel suit McDonald's launched against them into a global cyber
platform that put the ubiquitous food franchise on trial. There was an explosion of protest and
activity targeting Shell Oil after the shocking hanging of Nigerian author and anti-Shell activist
Ken Saro-Wiwa.

There was also the morning when I woke up and every billboard on my street had been "jammed"
with anticorporate slogans by midnight bandits. And the fact that the squeegee kids who slept in the
lobby of my building all seemed to be wearing homemade patches on their clothing with a Nike
"swoosh" logo and the word "Riot."
There was a common element shared by all these scattered issues and campaigns: in each case, the
focus of the attack was a brand-name corporation —
Nike, Shell, Wal-Mart, McDonald's (and others: Microsoft, Disney, Starbucks, Monsanto and so
on). Before I began writing this book, I didn't know if these pockets of anticorporate resistance had
anything in common besides their name-brand focus, but I wanted to find out. This personal quest
has taken me to a London courtroom for the handing down of the verdict in the McLibel Trial; to
Ken Saro-Wiwa's friends and family; to anti-sweatshop protests outside Nike Towns in New York
and San Francisco; and to union meetings in the food courts of glitzy malls. It took me on the road
with an "alternative" billboard salesman and on the prowl with "adbusters" out to "jam" the
meaning of those billboards with their own messages. And it brought me, too, to several impromptu
street parties whose organizers are determined to briefly liberate public space from its captivity by
ads, cars and cops. It took me to clandestine encounters with computer hackers threatening to
cripple the systems of American corporations found to be violating human rights in China.
Most memorably, it led me to factories and union squats in Southeast Asia, and to the outskirts of
Manila where Filipino workers are making labour history by bringing the first unions to the export
processing zones that produce the most recognizable brand-name consumer items on the planet.
Over the course of this journey, I came across an American student group that focuses on
multinationals in Burma, pressuring them to pull out because of the regime's violations of human
rights. In their communiqués, the student activists identify themselves as "Spiders" and the image
strikes me as a fitting one for this Web-age global activism. Logos, by the force of ubiquity, have
become the closest thing we have to an international language, recognized and understood in many
more places than English. Activists are now free to swing off this web of logos like spy/spiders —
trading information about labour practices, chemical spills, animal cruelty and unethical marketing
around the world.
I have become convinced that it is in these logo-forged global links that global citizens will
eventually find sustainable solutions for this sold planet. I don't claim that this book will articulate
the full agenda of a global movement that is still in its infancy. My concern has been to track the
early stages of resistance and to ask some basic questions. What conditions have set the stage for
this backlash? Successful multinational corporations are increasingly finding themselves under
attack, whether it's a cream pie in Bill Gates's face or the incessant parodying of the Nike swooshwhat are the forces pushing more and more people to become suspicious of or even downright
enraged at multinational corporations, the very engines of our global growth? Perhaps more
pertinently, what is liberating so many people - particularly young people —to act on that rage and
suspicion?
These questions may seem obvious, and certainly some obvious answers are kicking around. That
corporations have grown so big they have superseded government. That unlike governments, they
are accountable only to their shareholders; that we lack the mechanisms to make them answer to a
broader public. There have been several exhaustive books chronicling the ascendancy of what has

come to be called "corporate rule," many of which have proved invaluable to my own
understanding of global economics (see Reading List, page 479).
This book is not, however, another account of the power of the select group of corporate Goliaths
that have gathered to form our de facto global government. Rather, the book is an attempt to
analyze and document the forces opposing corporate rule, and to lay out the particular set of
cultural and economic conditions that made the emergence of that opposition inevitable. Part 1, "No
Space," examines the surrender of culture and education to marketing. Part 11, "No Choice,"
reports on how the promise of a vastly increased array of cultural choice was betrayed by the forces
of mergers, predatory franchising, synergy and corporate censorship. And Part 111, "No Jobs,"
examines the labour market trends that are creating increasingly tenuous relationships to
employment for many workers, including self-employment, McJobs and outsourcing, as well as
part-time and temp labour. It is the collision of and the interplay among these forces, the assault on
the three social pillars of employment, civil liberties and civic space, that is giving rise to the
Anticorporate activism chronicled in the last section of the book, Part IV, "No Logo," an activism
that is sowing the seeds of a genuine alternative to corporate rule.

CHAPTER ONE

NEW BRANDED WORLD

As a private person, I have a passion for landscape, and I have never seen one improved
by a billboard. Where every prospect pleases, man is at his vilest when he erects a
billboard. When I retire from Madison Avenue, I am going to start a secret society of
masked vigilantes who will travel around the world on silent motor bicycles, chopping
down posters at the dark of the moon. How many juries will convict us when we are
caught in these acts of beneficent citizenship?
— David Ogilvy, founder of the Ogilvy & Mather advertising agency, in Confessions of an Advertising Man,
1963

The astronomical growth in the wealth and cultural influence of multinational corporations over the
last fifteen years can arguably be traced back to a single, seemingly innocuous idea developed by
management theorists in the mid-1980s: that successful corporations must primarily produce
brands, as opposed to products.
Until that time, although it was understood in the corporate world that bolstering one's brand name
was important, the primary concern of every solid manufacturer was the production of goods. This
idea was the very gospel of the machine age. An editorial that appeared in Fortune magazine in
1938, for instance, argued that the reason the American economy had yet to recover from the
Depression was that America had lost sight of the importance of making things:
This is the proposition that the basic and irreversible function of an industrial economy is the making of things; that the
more things it makes the bigger will be the income, whether dollar or real; and hence that the key to those lost
recuperative powers lies... in the factory where the lathes and the drills and the fires and the hammers are. It is in the
factory and on the land and under the land that purchasing power originates [italics theirs].

And for the longest time, the making of things remained, at least in principle, the heart of all
industrialized economies. But by the eighties, pushed along by that decade's recession, some of the
most powerful manufacturers in the world had begun to falter. A consensus emerged that
corporations were bloated, oversized; they owned too much, employed too many people, and were
wired down with too many things. The very process of producing-running one's own factories,
being responsible for tens of thousands of full-time, permanent employees —began to look less like
the route to success and more like a clunky liability.

At around this same time a new kind of corporation began to rival the traditional all-American
manufacturers for market share; these were the Mikes and Microsoft’s, and later, the Tommy
Hilfiger’s and Intel’s. These pioneers made the bold claim that producing goods was only an
incidental part of their operations, and that thanks to recent victories in trade liberalization and
labour-law reform; they were able to have their products made for them by contractors, many of
them overseas. What these companies produced primarily were not things, they said, but images of
their brands. Their real work lay not in manufacturing but in marketing. This formula, needless to
say, has proved enormously profitable, and its success has companies competing in a race toward
weightlessness: whoever owns the least has the fewest employees on the payroll and produces the
most powerful images, as opposed to products, wins the race.
And so the wave of mergers in the corporate world over the last few years is a deceptive
phenomenon: it only looks as if the giants, by joining forces, are getting bigger and bigger. The true
key to understanding these shifts is to realize that in several crucial ways - not their profits, of
course - these merged companies are actually shrinking. Their apparent bigness is simply the most
effective route toward their real goal: divestment of the world of things.
Since many of today's best-known manufacturers no longer produce products and advertise them,
but rather buy products and "brand" them, these companies are forever on the prowl for creative
new ways to build and strengthen their brand images. Manufacturing products may require drills,
furnaces, hammers and the like, but creating a brand calls for a completely different set of tools and
materials. It requires an endless parade of brand extensions, continuously renewed imagery for
marketing and, most of all, fresh new spaces to disseminate the brand's idea of itself. In this section
of the book, I'll look at how, in ways both insidious and overt, this corporate obsession with brand
identity is waging a war on public and individual space: on public institutions such as schools, on
youthful identities, on the concept of nationality and on the possibilities for unmarketed space.

It's helpful to go back briefly and look at where the idea of branding first began. Though the words
are often used interchangeably, branding and advertising is not the same process. Advertising any
given product is only one part of branding's grand plan, as are sponsorship and logo licensing.
Think of the brand as the core meaning of the modern corporation, and of the advertisement as one
vehicle used to convey that meaning to the world.
The first mass-marketing campaigns, starting in the second half of the nineteenth century, had more
to do with advertising than with branding as we understand it today. Faced with a range of recently
invented products — the radio, phonograph, car, light bulb and so on - advertisers had more
pressing tasks than creating a brand identity for any given corporation; first, they had to change the
way people lived their lives. Ads had to inform consumers about the existence of some new
invention, then convince them that their lives would be better if they used, for example, cars instead
of wagons, telephones instead of mail and electric light instead of oil lamps. Many of these new
products bore brand names —some of which are still around today —but these were almost
incidental. These products were themselves news; that was almost advertisement enough.

The first brand-based products appeared at around the same time as the invention-based ads, largely
because of another relatively recent innovation:
The factory. When goods began to be produced in factories, not only were entirely new products
being introduced but old products — even basic staples -were appearing in strikingly new forms.
What made early branding efforts different from more straightforward salesmanship was that the
market was now being flooded with uniform mass-produced products that were virtually
indistinguishable from one another. Competitive branding became a necessity of the machine age
— within a context of manufactured sameness; image-based difference had to be manufactured
along with the product.
So the role of advertising changed from delivering product news bulletins to building an image
around a particular brand-name version of a product. The first task of branding was to bestow
proper names on generic goods such as sugar, flour, soap and cereal, which had previously been
scooped out of barrels by local shopkeepers. In the 1880s, corporate logos were introduced to massproduced products like Campbell's Soup, HJ. Heinz pickles and Quaker Oats cereal. As design
historians and theorists Ellen Lupton and J. Abbott Miller note, logos were tailored to evoke
familiarity and folksiness (see Aunt Jemima, page 2), in an effort to counteract the new and
unsettling anonymity of packaged goods. "Familiar personalities such as Dr. Brown, Uncle Ben,
Aunt Jemima, and Old Grand-Dad came to replace the shopkeeper, who was traditionally
responsible for measuring bulk foods for customers and acting as an advocate for products... a
nationwide vocabulary of brand names replaced the small local shopkeeper as the interface between
consumer and product." After the product names and characters had been established, advertising
gave them a venue to speak directly to would-be consumers. The corporate "personality," uniquely
named, packaged and advertised, had arrived.
For the most part, the ad campaigns at the end of the nineteenth century and the start of the
twentieth used a set of rigid, pseudoscientific formulas: rivals were never mentioned, ad copy used
declarative statements only and headlines had to be large, with lots of white space - according to
one turn-of-the-century adman, "an advertisement should be big enough to make an impression but
not any bigger than the thing advertised."
But there were those in the industry who understood that advertising wasn't just scientific; it was
also spiritual. Brands could conjure a feeling —
think of Aunt Jemima's comforting presence —but not only that, entire corporations could
themselves embody a meaning of their own. In the early twenties, legendary adman Bruce Barton
turned General Motors into a metaphor for the American family, "something personal, warm and
human," while GE was not so much the name of the faceless General Electric Company as, in
Barton's words, "the initials of a friend." In 1923 Barton said that the role of advertising was to help
corporations find their soul. The son of a preacher, he drew on his religious upbringing for uplifting
messages: "I like to think of advertising as something big, something splendid, something which
goes deep down into an institution and gets hold of the soul of it.... Institutions have souls, just as
men and nations have souls," he told GM president Pierre du Pont. General Motors ads began to tell
stories about the people who drove its cars — the preacher, the pharmacist or the country doctor
who, thanks to his trusty GM, arrived "at the bedside of a dying child" just in time "to bring it back
to life."

By the end of the 1940s, there was a burgeoning awareness that a brand wasn't just a mascot or a
catchphrase or a picture printed on the label of a company's product; the company as a whole could
have a brand identity or a "corporate consciousness," as this ephemeral quality was termed at the
time. As this idea evolved, the adman ceased to see himself as a pitchman and instead saw himself
as "the philosopher-king of commercial culture," in the words of ad critic Randall Rothberg. The
search for the true meaning of brands - or the "brand essence," as it is often called - gradually took
the agencies away from individual products and their attributes and toward a
psychological/anthropological examination of what brands mean to the culture and to people's lives.
This was seen to be of crucial importance, since corporations may manufacture products, but what
consumers buy are brands.
It took several decades for the manufacturing world to adjust to this shift. It clung to the idea that
its core business was still production and that branding was an important add-on. Then came the
brand equity mania of the eighties, the defining moment of which arrived in 1988 when Philip
Morris purchased Kraft for $12.6 billion-six times what the company was worth on paper. The
price difference, apparently, was the cost of the word "Kraft." Of course Wall Street was aware that
decades of marketing and brand bolstering added value to a company over and above its assets and
total annual sales. But with the Kraft purchase, a huge dollar value had been assigned to something
that had previously been abstract and unquantifiable -a brand name. This was spectacular news for
the ad world, which was now able to make the claim that advertising spending was more than just a
sales strategy: it was an investment in cold hard equity. The more you spend, the more your
company is worth. Not surprisingly, this led to a considerable increase in spending on advertising.
More important, it sparked a renewed interest in puffing up brand identities, a project that involved
far more than a few billboards and TV spots. It was about pushing the envelope in sponsorship
deals, dreaming up new areas in which to "extend" the brand, as well as perpetually probing the
Zeitgeist to ensure that the "essence" selected for one's brand would resonate karmically with its
target market. For reasons that will be explored in the rest of this chapter, this radical shift in
corporate philosophy has sent manufacturers on a cultural feeding frenzy as they seize upon every
corner of unmarketed landscape in search of the oxygen needed to inflate their brands. In the
process, virtually nothing has been left un-branded. That's quite an impressive feat, considering that
as recently as 1993 Wall Street had pronounced the brand dead, or as good as dead.

]7^_a`bj+dkmlOnoZ_4jJgF^qprstq+sm!nfuv^/	ew3^yxzj+k{`b__3dq|y!_4jJgF}L~U\j+cXcX_jJg$_k/
The evolution of the brand had one scary episode when it seemed to face extinction. To understand
this brush with death, we must first come to terms with advertising's own special law of gravity,
which holds that if you aren't rocketing upward you will soon come crashing down.
The marketing world is always reaching a new zenith, breaking through last year's world record and
planning to do it again next year with increasing numbers of ads and aggressive new formulae for
reaching consumers. The advertising industry's astronomical rate of growth is neatly reflected in
year-to-year figures measuring total ad spending in the U.S., which have gone up so steadily that by
1998 the figure was set to reach $196.5 billion, while global ad spending is estimated at $435

billion. According to the 1998 United Nations Human Development Report, the growth in global ad
spending "now outpaces the growth of the world economy by one-third."
This pattern is a by-product of the firmly held belief that brands need continuous and constantly
increasing advertising in order to stay in the same place. According to this law of diminishing
returns, the more advertising there is out there (and there always is more, because of this law), the
more aggressively brands must market to stand out. And of course, no one is more keenly aware of
advertising's ubiquity than the advertisers themselves, who view commercial inundation as a clear
and persuasive call for more-and more intrusive-advertising. With so much competition, the
agencies argue, clients must spend more than ever to make sure their pitch screeches so loud it can
be heard over all the others. David Lubars, a senior ad executive in the Omnicom Group, explains
the industry's guiding principle with more candour than most. Consumers, he says, "are like roaches
—you spray them and spray them and they get immune after a while."
So, if consumers are like roaches, then marketers must forever be dreaming up new concoctions for
industrial-strength Raid. And nineties marketers, being on a more advanced rung of the sponsorship
spiral, have dutifully come up with clever and intrusive new selling techniques to do just that.
Recent highlights include these innovations: Gordon's gin experimented with filling British movie
theatres with the scent of juniper berries; Calvin Klein stuck "CK Be" perfume strips on the backs
of Ticketmaster concert envelopes; and in some Scandinavian countries you can get "free" longdistance calls with ads cutting into your telephone conversations. And there's plenty more,
stretching across ever more expansive surfaces and cramming into the smallest of crevices: sticker
ads on pieces of fruit promoting ABC sitcoms, Levi's ads in public washrooms, corporate logos on
boxes of Girl Guide cookies, ads for pop albums on takeout food containers, and ads for Batman
movies projected on sidewalks or into the night sky. There are already ads on benches in national
parks as well as on library cards in public libraries, and in December 1998 NASA announced plans
to solicit ads on its space stations. Pepsi's ongoing threat to project its logo onto the moon's surface
hasn't yet materialized, but Mattel did paint an entire street in Salford, England, "a shriekingly
bright bubblegum hue" of pink-houses, porches, trees, road, sidewalk, dogs and cars were all
accessories in the televised celebrations of Barbie Pink Month. Barbie is but one small part of the
ballooning $30 billion "experiential communication" industry, the phrase now used to encompass
the staging of such branded pieces of corporate performance art and other "happenings." That we
live a sponsored life is now a truism and it's a pretty safe bet that as spending on advertising
continues to rise, we roaches will be treated to even more of these ingenious gimmicks, making it
ever more difficult and more seemingly pointless to muster even an ounce of outrage.

But as mentioned earlier, there was a time when the new frontiers facing the advertising industry
weren't looking quite so promising. On April 2, 1993, advertising itself was called into question by
the very brands the industry had been building, in some cases, for over two centuries. That day is
known in marketing circles as "Marlboro Friday," and it refers to a sudden announcement from
Philip Morris that it would slash the price of Marlboro cigarettes by 20 percent in an attempt to
compete with bargain brands that were eating into its market. The pundits went nuts, announcing in
frenzied unison that not only was Marlboro dead, all brand names were dead. The reasoning was
that if a "prestige" brand like Marlboro, whose image had been carefully groomed, preened and
enhanced with more than a billion advertising dollars, was desperate enough to compete with no-

names, then clearly the whole concept of branding had lost its currency. The public had seen the
advertising, and the public didn't care. The Marlboro Man, after all, was not any old campaign;
launched in 1954, it was the longest-running ad campaign in history. It was a legend. If the
Marlboro Man had crashed, well, then, brand equity had crashed as well. The implication that
Americans were suddenly thinking for themselves en masse reverberated through Wall Street. The
same day Philip Morris announced its price cut, stock prices nose-dived for all the household
brands: Heinz, Quaker Oats, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Procter and Gamble and RJR Nabisco. Philip
Morris's own stock took the worst beating. Bob Stanojev, national director of consumer products
marketing for Ernst and Young, explained the logic behind Wall Street's panic: "If one or two
powerhouse consumer products companies start to cut prices for good, there's going to be an
avalanche. Welcome to the value generation."
Yes, it was one of those moments of overstated instant consensus, but it was not entirely without
cause. Marlboro had always sold itself on the strength of its iconic image marketing, not on
anything as prosaic as its price. As we now know, the Marlboro Man survived the price wars
without sustaining too much damage. At the time, however, Wall Street saw Philip Morris's
decision as symbolic of a sea change. The price cut was an admission that Marlboro's name was no
longer sufficient to sustain the flagship position, which in a context where image is equity meant
that Marlboro had blinked. And when Marlboro-one of the quintessential global brands -blinks, it
raises questions about branding that reach beyond Wall Street, and way beyond Philip Morris.
The panic of Marlboro Friday was not a reaction to a single incident. Rather, it was the culmination
of years of escalating anxiety in the face of some rather dramatic shifts in consumer habits that were
seen to be eroding the market share of household-name brands, from Tide to Kraft. Bargainconscious shoppers, hit hard by the recession, were starting to pay more attention to price than to
the prestige bestowed on their products by the yuppie ad campaigns of the 1980s. The public was
suffering from a bad case of what is known in the industry as "brand blindness."
Study after study showed that baby boomers, blind to the alluring images of advertising and deaf to
the empty promises of celebrity spokespersons, were breaking their lifelong brand loyalties and
choosing to feed their families with private-label brands from the supermarket - claiming,
heretically, that they couldn't tell the difference. From the beginning of the recession to 1993,
Loblaw's President's Choice line, Wal-Mart's Great Value and Marks and Spencer's St. Michael
prepared foods had nearly doubled their market share in North America and Europe. The computer
market, meanwhile, was flooded by inexpensive clones, causing IBM to slash its prices and
otherwise impale itself. It appeared to be a return to the proverbial shopkeeper dishing out generic
goods from the barrel in a prebranded era.
The bargain craze of the early nineties shook the name brands to their core. Suddenly it seemed
smarter to put resources into price reductions and other incentives than into fabulously expensive ad
campaigns. This ambivalence began to be reflected in the amounts companies were willing to pay
for so-called brand-enhancing advertising. Then, in 1991, it happened: overall advertising spending
actually went down by 5.5 percent for the top 100 brands. It was the first interruption in the steady
increase of U.S. ad expenditures since a tiny dip of 0.6 percent in 1970, and the largest drop in four
decades.

It's not that top corporations weren't flogging their products, it's just that to attract those suddenly
fickle customers, many decided to put their money into promotions such as giveaways, contests, instore displays and (like Marlboro) price reductions. In 1983, American brands spent 70 percent of
their total marketing budgets on advertising, and 30 percent on these other forms of promotion. By
1993, the ratio had flipped: only 25 percent went to ads, with the remaining 75 percent going to
promotions.
Predictably, the ad agencies panicked when they saw their prestige clients abandoning them for the
bargain bins and they did what they could to convince big spenders like Procter and Gamble and
Philip Morris that the proper route out of the brand crisis wasn't less brand marketing but more. At
the annual meeting of the U.S. Association of National Advertisers in 1988, Graham H. Phillips,
the U.S. chairman of Ogilvy & Mather, berated the assembled executives for stooping to participate
in "a commodity marketplace" rather than an image-based one. "I doubt that many of you would
welcome a commodity marketplace in which one competed solely on price, promotion and trade
deals, all of which can easily be duplicated by competition, leading to ever-decreasing profits,
decay and eventual bankruptcy." Others spoke of the importance of maintaining "conceptual valueadded," which in effect means adding nothing but marketing. Stooping to compete on the basis of
real value, the agencies ominously warned, would spell not just the death of the brand, but
corporate death as well.
Around the same time as Marlboro Friday, the ad industry felt so under siege that market researcher
Jack Myers published Adbashing: Surviving the Attacks on Advertising, a book-length call to arms
against everyone from supermarket cashiers handing out coupons for canned peas to legislators
contemplating a new tax on ads. "We, as an industry, must recognize that adbashing is a threat to
capitalism, to a free press, to our basic forms of entertainment, and to the future of our children," he
wrote. Despite these fighting words, most market watchers remained convinced that the heyday of
the value-added brand had come and gone. The eighties had gone in for brands and hoity-toity
designer labels, reasoned David Scotland, European director of Hiram Walker. The nineties would
clearly be all about value. "A few years ago," he observed, "it might have been considered smart to
wear a shirt with a designer's logo embroidered on the pocket; frankly, it now seems a bit naff."
And from the other side of the Atlantic, Cincinnati journalist Shelly Reese came to the same
conclusion about our no-name future, writing that "Americans with Calvin Klein splashed across
their hip pocket aren't pushing grocery carts full of Perrier down the aisles anymore. Instead they're
sporting togs with labels like Kmart's Jaclyn Smith and manoeuvring carts full of Kroger Co.'s Big
K soda. Welcome to the private label decade."
Scotland and Reese, if they remember their bold pronouncements, are probably feeling just a little
bit silly right now. Their embroidered "pocket" logos sound positively subdued by today's logo
maniacal standards, and sales of name-brand bottled water have been increasing at an annual rate of
9 percent, turning it into a $3.4 billion industry by 1997. From today's logo-quilted perch, it's
almost unfathomable that a mere six years ago, death sentences for the brand seemed not only
plausible but self-evident.
So just how did we get from obituaries for Tide to today's battalions of volunteer billboards for
Tommy Hilfiger, Nike and Calvin Klein? Who slipped the steroids into the brand's comeback?

]7^_a`bj+dk<n`i+sdw3_a`ijJw4
There were some brands that were watching from the sidelines as Wall Street declared the death of
the brand. Funny, they must have thought, we don't feel dead.
Just as the admen had predicted at the beginning of the recession, the companies that exited the
downturn running were the ones who opted for marketing over value every time: Nike, Apple, the
Body Shop, Calvin Klein, Disney, Levi's and Starbucks. Not only were these brands doing just fine,
thank you very much, but the act of branding was becoming a larger and larger focus of their
businesses. For these companies, the ostensible product was mere filler for the real production: the
brand. They integrated the idea of branding into the very fabric of their companies. Their corporate
cultures were so tight and cloistered that to outsiders they appeared to be a cross between fraternity
house, religious cult and sanatorium. Everything was an ad for the brand: bizarre lexicons for
describing employees (partners, baristas, team players, and crew members), company chants,
superstar CEOs, fanatical attention to design consistency, a propensity for monument-building and
New Age mission statements. Unlike classic household brand names, such as Tide and Marlboro,
these logos weren't losing their currency; they were in the midst of breaking every barrier in the
marketing world —becoming cultural accessories and lifestyle philosophers. These companies
didn't wear their image like a cheap shirt —their image was so integrated with their business that
other people wore it as their shirt. And when the brands crashed, these companies didn't even notice
—they were branded to the bone.
So the real legacy of Marlboro Friday is that it simultaneously brought the two most significant
developments in nineties marketing and consumerism into sharp focus: the deeply unhip big-box
bargain stores that provide the essentials of life and monopolize a disproportionate share of the
market (Wal-Mart ct al.) and the extra-premium "attitude" brands that provide the essentials of
lifestyle and monopolize ever-expanding stretches of cultural space (Nike et al.). The way these two
tiers of consumerism developed would have a profound impact on the economy in the years to
come. When overall ad expenditures took a nosedive in 1991, Nike and Reebok were busy playing
advertising chicken, with each company increasing its budget to outspend the other. In 1991 alone,
Reebok upped its ad spending by 71.9 percent, while Nike pumped an extra 24.6 percent into its
already soaring ad budget, bringing the company's total spending on marketing to a staggering $250
million annually. Far from worrying about competing on price, the sneaker pimps were designing
ever more intricate and pseudoscientific air pockets, and driving up prices by signing star athletes to
colossal sponsorship deals. The fetish strategy seemed to be working fine: in the six years prior to
1993, Nike had gone from a $750 million company to a $4 billion one and Phil Knight's Beaverton,
Oregon, company emerged from the recession with profits 900 percent higher than when it began.
Benetton and Calvin Klein, meanwhile, were also upping their spending on lifestyle marketing,
using ads to associate their lines with risqué art and progressive politics. Clothes barely appeared in
these high-concept advertisements, let alone prices. Even more abstract was Absolut Vodka, which
for some years now had been developing a marketing strategy in which its product disappeared and
its brand was nothing but a blank bottle-shaped space that could be filled with whatever content a
particular audience most wanted from its brands: intellectual in Harper's, futuristic in Wired,

alternative in Spin, loud and proud in Out and "Absolut Centrefold" in Playboy. The brand
reinvented itself as a cultural sponge, soaking up and morphing to its surroundings.
Saturn, too, came out of nowhere in October 1990 when GM launched a car built not out of steel
and rubber but out of New Age spirituality and seventies feminism. After the car had been on the
market a few years, the company held a "homecoming" weekend for Saturn owners, during which
they could visit the auto plant and have a cookout with the people who made their cars. As the
Saturn ads boasted at the time, "44,000 people spent their vacations with us, at a car plant." It was
as if Aunt Jemima had come to life and invited you over to her house for dinner.
In 1993, the year the Marlboro Man was temporarily hobbled by "brand-blind" consumers,
Microsoft made its striking debut on Advertising Age's list of the top 200 ad spenders-the very
same year that Apple computer increased its marketing budget by 30 percent after already making
branding history with its Orwellian takeoff ad launch during the 1984 Super Bowl (see image on
page 86). Like Saturn, both companies were selling a hip new relationship to the machine that left
Big Blue IBM looking as clunky and menacing as the now-dead Cold War.
And then there were the companies that had always understood that they were selling brands before
product. Coke, Pepsi, McDonald's, Burger King and Disney weren't fazed by the brand crisis,
opting instead to escalate the brand war, especially since they had their eyes firmly fixed on global
expansion. They were joined in this project by a wave of sophisticated producer/retailers who hit
full stride in the late eighties and early nineties. The Gap, Ikea and the Body Shop were spreading
like wildfire during this period, masterfully transforming the generic into the brand-specific, largely
through bold, carefully branded packaging and the promotion of an "experiential" shopping
environment. The Body Shop had been a presence in Britain since the seventies, but it wasn't until
1988 that it began sprouting like a green weed on every street corner in the U.S. Even during the
darkest years of the recession, the company opened between forty and fifty American stores a year.
Most baffling of all to Wall Street, it pulled off the expansion without spending a dime on
advertising. Who needed billboards and magazine ads when retail outlets were three-dimensional
advertisements for an ethical and ecological approach to cosmetics? The Body Shop was all brand.
The Starbucks coffee chain, meanwhile, was also expanding during this period without laying out
much in advertising; instead, it was spinning off its name into a wide range of branded projects:
Starbucks airline coffee, office coffee, coffee ice cream, coffee beer. Starbucks seemed to
understand brand names at a level even deeper than Madison Avenue, incorporating marketing into
every fibre of its corporate concept-from the chain's strategic association with books, blues and jazz
to its Euro-latte lingo. What the success of both the Body Shop and Starbucks showed was how far
the branding project had come in moving beyond splashing one's logo on a billboard. Here were
two companies that had fostered powerful identities by making their brand concept into a virus and
sending it out into the culture via a variety of channels: cultural sponsorship, political controversy,
the consumer experience and brand extensions. Direct advertising, in this context, was viewed as a
rather clumsy intrusion into a much more organic approach to image building.

Scott Bedbury, Starbucks' vice president of marketing, openly recognized that "consumers don't
truly believe there's a huge difference between products," which is why brands must "establish
emotional ties" with their customers through "the Starbucks Experience." The people who line up

for Starbucks, writes CEO Howard Shultz, aren't just there for the coffee. "It's the romance of the
coffee experience, the feeling of warmth and community people get in Starbucks stores."
Interestingly, before moving to Starbucks, Bedbury was head of marketing at Nike, where he
oversaw the launch of the "Just Do It!" slogan, among other watershed branding moments. In the
following passage, he explains the common techniques used to infuse the two very different brands
with meaning:
Nike, for example, is leveraging the deep emotional connection that people have with sports and fitness. With
Starbucks, we see how coffee has woven itself into the fabric of people's lives, and that's our opportunity for emotional
leverage.... A great brand raises the bar-it adds a greater sense of purpose to the experience, whether it's the challenge
to do your best in sports and fitness or the affirmation that the cup of coffee you're drinking really matters.

This was the secret; it seemed, of all the success stories of the late eighties and early nineties. The
lesson of Marlboro Friday was that there never really was a brand crisis - only brands that had
crises of confidence. The brands would be okay, Wall Street concluded, so long as they believed
fervently in the principles of branding and never, ever blinked. Overnight, "Brands, not products!"
became the rallying cry for a marketing renaissance led by a new breed of companies that saw
themselves as "meaning brokers" instead of product producers. What was changing was the idea of
what -in both advertising and branding-was being sold. The old paradigm had it that all marketing
was selling a product. In the new model, however, the product always takes a back seat to the real
product, the brand, and the selling of the brand acquired an extra component that can only be
described as spiritual. Advertising is about hawking product. Branding, in its truest and most
advanced incarnations, is about corporate transcendence.
It may sound flaky, but that's precisely the point. On Marlboro Friday, a line was drawn in the sand
between the lowly price slashers and the high-concept brand builders. The brand builders
conquered and a new consensus was born: the products that will flourish in the future will be the
ones presented not as "commodities" but as concepts: the brand as experience, as lifestyle.
Ever since, a select group of corporations has been attempting to free itself from the corporeal
world of commodities, manufacturing and products to exist on another plane. Anyone can
manufacture a product, they reason (and as the success of private-label brands during the recession
proved, anyone did). Such menial tasks, therefore, can and should be farmed out to contractors and
subcontractors whose only concern is filling the order on time and under budget (ideally in the
Third World, where labour is dirt cheap, laws are lax and tax breaks come by the bushel).
Headquarters, meanwhile, is free to focus on the real business at hand — creating a corporate
mythology powerful enough to infuse meaning into these raw objects just by signing its name.
The corporate world has always had a deep New Age streak; fed-it has become clear —by a
profound need that could not be met simply by trading widgets for cash. But when branding
captured the corporate imagination, New Age vision quests took centre stage. As Nike CEO Phil
Knight explains, "For years we thought of ourselves as a production-oriented company, meaning
we put all our emphasis on designing and manufacturing the product. But now we understand that
the most important thing we do is market the product. We've come around to saying that Nike is a
marketing-oriented company, and the product is our most important marketing tool." This project
has since been taken to an even more advanced level with the emergence of on-line corporate giants
such as Amazon.com. It is on-line that the purest brands are being built: liberated from the real-

world burdens of stores and product manufacturing, these brands are free to soar, less as the
disseminators of goods or services than as collective hallucinations.
Tom Peters, who has long coddled the inner flake in many a hard-nosed CEO, latched on to the
branding craze as the secret to financial success, separating the transcendental logos and the
earthbound products into two distinct categories of companies. "The top half-Coca-Cola, Microsoft,
Disney, and so on - are pure 'players' in brainware. The bottom half [Ford and GM] are still lumpyobject purveyors, though automobiles are much 'smarter' than they used to be," Peters writes in The
Circle of Innovation (1997), an ode to the power of marketing over production.
When Levi's began to lose market share in the late nineties, the trend was widely attributed to the
company's failure — despite lavish ad spending — to transcend its products and become a freestanding meaning. "Maybe one of Levi's problems is that it has no Cola," speculated Jennifer
Steinhauer in The New York Times. "It has no denim-toned house paint. Levi makes what is
essentially a commodity: blue jeans. Its ads may evoke rugged out-doorsmanship, but Levi hasn't
promoted any particular life style to sell other products."
In this high-stakes new context, the cutting-edge ad agencies no longer sold companies on
individual campaigns but on their ability to act as "brand stewards": identifying, articulating and
protecting the corporate soul. Not surprisingly, this spelled good news for the U.S. advertising
industry, which in 1994 saw a spending increase of 8.6 percent over the previous year. In one year,
the ad industry went from a near crisis to another "best year yet." And that was only the beginning
of triumphs to come. By 1997, corporate advertising, defined as "ads that position a corporation, its
values, its personality and character" were up 18 percent from the year before.
With this wave of brand mania has come a new breed of businessman, one who will proudly inform
you that Brand X is not a product but a way of life, an attitude, a set of values, a look, an idea. And
it sounds really great - way better than that Brand X is a screwdriver, or a hamburger chain, or a
pair of jeans, or even a very successful line of running shoes. Nike, Phil Knight announced in the
late eighties, is "a sports company"; its mission is not to sell shoes but to "enhance people's lives
through sports and fitness" and to keep "the magic of sports alive." Company president-cumsneaker-shaman Tom Clark explains that "the inspiration of sports allows us to rebirth ourselves
constantly."
Reports of such "brand vision" epiphanies began surfacing from all corners. "Polaroid's problem,"
diagnosed the chairman of its advertising agency, John Hegarty, "was that they kept thinking of
themselves as a camera. But the '[brand] vision' process taught us something: Polaroid is not a
camera-it's a social lubricant." IBM isn't selling computers, its selling business "solutions." Swatch
is not about watches, it is about the idea of time. At Diesel Jeans, owner Renzo Rosso told Paper
magazine, "We don't sell a product; we sell a style of life. I think we have created a movement....
The Diesel concept is everything. It's the way to live, it's the way to wear, it's the way to do
something." And as Body Shop founder Anita Roddick explained to me, her stores aren't about
what they sell, they are the conveyers of a grand idea — a political philosophy about women, the
environment and ethical business. "I just use the company that I surprisingly created as a success —
it shouldn't have been like this, it wasn't meant to be like this —to stand on the products to shout
out on these issues," Roddick says.

The famous late graphic designer Tibor Kalman summed up the shifting role of the brand this way:
"The original notion of the brand was quality, but now brand is a stylistic badge of courage."
The idea of selling the courageous message of a brand, as opposed to a product, intoxicated these
CEOs, providing as it did an opportunity for seemingly limitless expansion. After all, if a brand was
not a product, it could be anything! And nobody embraced branding theory with more evangelical
zeal than Richard Branson, whose Virgin Group has branded joint ventures in everything from
music to bridal gowns to airlines to cola to financial services. Branson refers derisively to the
"stilted Anglo-Saxon view of consumers," which holds that a name should be associated with a
product like sneakers or soft drinks, and opts instead for "the Asian 'trick'" of the keiretsus (a
Japanese term meaning a network of linked corporations). The idea, he explains, is to "build brands
not around products but around reputation. The great Asian names imply quality, price and
innovation rather than a specific item. I call these 'attribute' brands: They do not relate directly to
one product — such as a Mars bar or a Coca-Cola — but instead to a set of values."
Tommy Hilfiger, meanwhile, is less in the business of manufacturing clothes than he is in the
business of signing his name. The company is run entirely through licensing agreements, with
Hilfiger commissioning all its products from a group of other companies: Jockey International
makes Hilfiger underwear, Pepe Jeans London makes Hilfiger jeans, Oxford Industries make
Tommy shirts, and the Stride Rite Corporation makes its footwear. What does Tommy Hilfiger
manufacture? Nothing at all.
So passé had products become in the age of lifestyle branding that by the late nineties, newer
companies like Lush cosmetics and Old Navy clothing began playing with the idea of old-style
commodities as a source of retro marketing imagery. The Lush chain serves up its face masks and
moisturizers out of refrigerated stainless-steel bowls, spooned into plastic containers with grocerystore labels. Old Navy showcases its shrink-wrapped T-shirts and sweatshirts in deli-style chrome
refrigerators, as if they were meat or cheese. When you are a pure, concept-driven brand, the
aesthetics of raw product can prove as "authentic" as loft living.
And lest the branding business be dismissed as the playground of trendy consumer items such as
sneakers, jeans and New Age beverages, think again. Caterpillar, best known for building tractors
and busting unions, has barrelled into the branding business, launching the Cat accessories line:
boots, backpacks, hats and anything else calling out for a post-industrial je ne sais quoi. Intel Corp.,
which makes computer parts no one sees and few understand, transformed its processors into a
fetish brand with TV ads featuring line workers in funky metallic space suits dancing to "Shake
Your Groove Thing." The Intel mascots proved so popular that the company has sold hundreds of
thousands of bean-filled dolls modelled on the shimmery dancing technicians. Little wonder, then,
that when asked about the company's decision to diversify its products, the senior vice president for
sales and marketing, Paul S. Otellini, replied that Intel is "like Coke. One brand, many different
products."
And if Caterpillar and Intel can brand, surely anyone can.

There is, in fact, a new strain in marketing theory that holds that even the lowliest natural resources,
barely processed, can develop brand identities, thus giving way to hefty premium-price mark-ups.
In an essay appropriately titled "How to Brand Sand," advertising executives Sam I. Hill, Jack
McGrath and Sandeep Dayal team up to tell the corporate world that with the right marketing plan,
nobody has to stay stuck in the stuff business. "Based on extensive research, we would argue that
you can indeed brand not only sand, but also wheat, beef, brick, metals, concrete, chemicals, corn
grits and an endless variety of commodities traditionally considered immune to the process."
Over the past six years, spooked by the near-death experience of Marlboro Friday, global
corporations have leaped on the brand-wagon with what can only be described as a religious
fervour. Never again would the corporate world stoop to praying at the altar of the commodity
market. From now on they would worship only graven media images. Or to quote Tom Peters, the
brand man himself: "Brand! Brand!! Brand!!! That's the message... for the late '90s and beyond."

CHAPTER TWO
THE BRAND EXPANDS

Since the crocodile is the symbol of Lacoste, we thought they might be interested in sponsoring our
crocodiles.
— Silvino Gomes, commercial director of the Lisbon Zoo, n the institution's creative corporate ponsorship
program, March 1998

I was in Grade 4 when skin-tight designer jeans were the be-all and end-all, and my friends and I
spent a lot of time checking out each other's butt for logos. "Nothing comes between me and my
Calvins," Brooke Shields assured us, and as we lay back on our beds Ophelia-style and yanked up
the zippers on our Jordache jeans with wire hangers, we knew she was telling no word of a lie. At
around the same time, Romi, our schools own pint-sized Farrah Fawcett, used to make her rounds
up and down the rows of desks turning back the collars on our sweaters and polo shirts. It wasn't
enough for her to see an alligator or a leaping horseman —it could have been a knockoff. She
wanted to see the label behind the logo. We were only eight years old but the reign of logo terror
had begun.
About nine years later, I had a job folding sweaters at an Esprit clothing store in Montreal. Mothers
would come in with their six-year-old daughters and ask to see only the shirts that said "Esprit" in
the company's trademark bold block lettering. "She won't wear anything without a name," the
moms would confide apologetically as we chatted by the change rooms. It's no secret that branding
has become far more ubiquitous and intrusive by now. Labels like Baby Gap and Gap Newborn
imprint brand awareness on toddlers and turn babies into mini-billboards. My friend Monica tells
me that her seven-year-old son marks his homework not with check marks but with little red Nike
swooshes.
Until the early seventies, logos on clothes were generally hidden from view, discreetly placed on
the inside of the collar. Small designer emblems did appear on the outside of shirts in the first half
of the century, but such sporty attire was pretty much restricted to the golf courses and tennis courts
of the rich. In the late seventies, when the fashion world rebelled against Aquarian flamboyance,
the country-club wear of the fifties became mass style for newly conservative parents and their
preppy kids. Ralph Lauren's Polo horseman and Izod Lacoste's alligator escaped from the golf
course and scurried into the streets, dragging the logo decisively onto the outside of the shirt. These
logos served the same social function as keeping the clothing's price tag on: everyone knew
precisely what premium the wearer was willing to pay for style. By the mid-eighties, Lacoste and
Ralph Lauren were joined by Calvin Klein, Esprit and, in Canada, Roots; gradually, the logo was
transformed from an ostentatious affectation to an active fashion accessory. Most significantly, the
logo itself was growing in size, ballooning from a three-quarter-inch emblem into a chest-sized
marquee. This process of logo inflation is still progressing, and none is more bloated than Tommy

Hilfiger, who has managed to pioneer a clothing style that transforms its faithful adherents into
walking, talking, life-sized Tommy dolls, mummified in fully branded Tommy worlds.
This scaling-up of the logo's role has been so dramatic that it has become a change in substance.
Over the past decade and a half, logos have grown so dominant that they have essentially
transformed the clothing on which they appear into empty carriers for the brands they represent.
The metaphorical alligator, in other words, has risen up and swallowed the literal shirt.
This trajectory mirrors the larger transformation our culture has undergone since Marlboro Friday,
sparked by a stampede of manufacturers looking to replace their cumbersome product-production
apparatus with transcendent brand names and to infuse their brands with deep, meaningful
messages. By the mid-nineties, companies like Nike, Polo and Tommy Hilfiger were ready to take
branding to the next level: no longer simply branding their own products, but branding the outside
culture as well—by sponsoring cultural events, they could go out into the world and claim bits of it
as brand-name outposts. For these companies, branding was not just a matter of adding value to a
product. It was about thirstily soaking up cultural ideas and iconography that their brands could
reflect by projecting these ideas and images back on the culture as "extensions" of their brands.
Culture, in other words, would add value to their brands. For example, Onute Miller, senior brand
manager for Tequila Sauza, explains that her company sponsored a risqué photography exhibit by
George Holz because "art was a natural synergy with our product."
Branding's current state of cultural expansionism is about much more than traditional corporate
sponsorships: the classic arrangement in which a company donates money to an event in exchange
for seeing its logo on a banner or in a program. Rather, this is the Tommy Hilfiger approach of fullfrontal branding, applied now to cityscapes, music, art, films, community events, magazines, sports
and schools. This ambitious project makes the logo the central focus of everything it touches - not
an add-on or a happy association, but the main attraction.
Advertising and sponsorship have always been about using imagery to equate products with
positive cultural or social experiences. What makes nineties-style branding different is that it
increasingly seeks to take these associations out of the representational realm and make them a
lived reality. So the goal is not merely to have child actors drinking Coke in a TV commercial, but
for students to brainstorm concepts for Coke's next ad campaign in English class. It transcends
logo-festooned Roots clothing designed to conjure memories of summer camp and reaches out to
build an actual Roots country lodge that becomes a 3-D manifestation of the Roots brand concept.
Disney transcends its sports network ESP1M, a channel for guys who like to sit around in sports
bars screaming at the TV, and launches a line of ESPN Sports Bars, complete with giant-screen
TVs. The branding process reaches beyond heavily marketed Swatch watches and launches
"Internet time," a new venture for the Swatch Group, which divides the day into one thousand
"Swatch beats." The Swiss company is now attempting to convince the on-line world to abandon
the traditional clock and switch to its time-zone-free, branded time.
The effect, if not always the original intent, of advanced branding is to nudge the hosting culture
into the background and make the brand the star. It is not to sponsor culture but to be the culture.
And why shouldn't it be? If brands are not products but ideas, attitudes, values and experiences,
why can't they be culture too? As we will see later in the chapter, this project has been so successful
that the lines between corporate sponsors and sponsored culture have entirely disappeared. But this

conflation has not been a one-way process, with passive artists allowing themselves to be shoved
into the background by aggressive multinational corporations. Rather, many artists, media
personalities, film directors and sports stars have been racing to meet the corporations halfway in
the branding game. Michael Jordan, Puff Daddy, Martha Stewart, Austin Powers, Brandy and Star
Wars now mirror the corporate structure of corporations like Nike and the Gap, and they are just as
captivated by the prospect of developing and leveraging their own branding potential as the
product-based manufacturers. So what was once a process of selling culture to a sponsor for a price
has been supplanted by the logic of "co-branding" - a fluid partnership between celebrity people
and celebrity brands.
The project of transforming culture into little more than a collection of brand-extensions-in-waiting
would not have been possible without the deregulation and privatization policies of the past three
decades. In Canada under Brian Mulroney, in the U.S. under Ronald Reagan and in Britain under
Margaret Thatcher (and in many other parts of the world as well), corporate taxes were dramatically
lowered, a move that eroded the tax base and gradually starved out the public sector. As
government spending dwindled, schools, museums and broadcasters were desperate to make up
their budget shortfalls and thus ripe for partnerships with private corporations. It also didn't hurt
that the political climate during this time ensured that there was almost no vocabulary to speak
passionately about the value of a non-commercialized public sphere. This was the time of the Big
Government bogeyman and deficit hysteria, when any political move that was not overtly designed
to increase the freedom of corporations was vilified as an endorsement of national bankruptcy. It
was against this backdrop that, in rapid order, sponsorship went from being a rare occurrence (in
the 1970s) to an exploding growth industry (by the mid-eighties), picking up momentum in 1984 at
the Los Angeles Olympics.
At first, these arrangements seemed win-win: the cultural or educational institution in question
received much-needed funds and the sponsoring corporation was compensated with some modest
form of public acknowledgment and a tax break. And, in fact, many of these new public-private
arrangements were just that simple, successfully retaining a balance between the cultural event or
institution's independence and the sponsor's desire for credit, often helping to foster a revival of arts
accessible to the general public. Successes like these are frequently overlooked by critics of
commercialization, among whom there is an unfortunate tendency to tar all sponsorship with the
same brush, as if any contact with a corporate logo infects the natural integrity of an otherwise
pristine public event or cause. Writing in The Commercialization of American Culture, advertising
critic Matthew McAllister labels corporate sponsorship "control behind a philanthropic facade." He
writes:
While elevating the corporate, sponsorship simultaneously devalues what it sponsors.... The
sporting event, the play, the concert and the public television program become subordinate to
promotion because, in the sponsor's mind and in the symbolism of the event, they exist to promote.
It is not Art for Art's Sake as much as Art for Ad's Sake. In the public's eye, art is yanked from its
own separate and theoretically autonomous domain and squarely placed in the commercial....
Every time the commercial intrudes on the cultural, the integrity of the public sphere is weakened
because of the obvious encroachment of corporate promotion.

This picture of our culture's lost innocence is mostly romantic fiction. Though there have always
been artists who have fought fiercely to protect the integrity of their work, neither the arts, sports
nor the media have ever, even theoretically, been the protected sovereign states that McAllister
imagines. Cultural products are the all-time favourite playthings of the powerful, tossed from
wealthy statesmen such as Gaius Cilnius Maecenas, who set up the poet Horace in a writing estate
in 33 B.C., and from rulers like Francis I and the Medici family, whose love of the arts bolstered
the status of Renaissance painters in the sixteenth century. Though the degree of meddling varies,
our culture was built on compromises between notions of public good and the personal, political
and financial ambitions of the rich and powerful.
Of course there are some forms of corporate sponsorship that are inherently insidious - the tobacco
industry's corralling of the arts springs to mind. But not all sponsorship deals should be so easily
dismissed. Not only are such broad strokes unfair to worthy projects but, perhaps more important,
they can prevent us from seeing changes in the field. If all corporate sponsorship arrangements are
regarded as equally compromised, it becomes easy not to notice when the role of the corporate
sponsor begins to expand and change — which is precisely what has been happening over the past
decade as global corporate sponsorship has ballooned from a $7-billion-a-year industry in 1991 to a
$19.2 billion one in 1999.

When sponsorship took off as a stand-in for public funds in the mid-eighties, many corporations
that had been experimenting with the practice ceased to see sponsorship as a hybrid of philanthropy
and image promotion and began to treat it more purely as a marketing tool, and a highly effective
one at that. As its promotional value grew — and as dependency on sponsorship revenue increased
in the cultural industries — the delicate dynamic between sponsors and the sponsored began to
shift, with many corporations becoming more ambitious in their demands for grander
acknowledgments and control, even buying events outright. Molson and Miller beer, as we will see
further on in this chapter, are no longer satisfied with having their logos on banners at rock
concerts. Instead, they have pioneered a new kind of sponsored concert in which the blue-chip stars
who perform are entirely upstaged by their hosting brand. And while corporate sponsorship has
long been a mainstay in museums and galleries, when Philip Morris-owned Altoids mints decided
in January 1999 that it wanted to get into the game, it cut out the middleman. Rather than
sponsoring an existing show, the company spent $250,000 to buy works by twenty emerging artists
and launch its own Curiously Strong Collection, a travelling art exhibition that plays on the Altoids
marketing slogan, "Curiously strong mints." Chris Peddy, Altoids brand manager, said, "We
decided to take it to the next level."
These companies are part of a larger phenomenon explained by Lesa Ukman, executive editor of
the International Events Group Sponsorship Report, the industry's bible: "From MasterCard and
Dannon to Phoenix Home Life and LaSalle Bank, companies are buying properties and creating
their own events. This is not because they want to get into the business. It's because proposals
sponsors receive don't fit their requirements or because they've had negative experiences buying
into someone else's gig." There is a certain logic to this progression: first, a select group of
manufacturers transcend their connection to their earthbound products, then, with marketing
elevated as the pinnacle of their businesses, they attempt to alter marketing's social status as a
commercial interruption and replace it with seamless integration.
The most insidious effect of this shift is that after a few years of Molson concerts, Pepsi-sponsored
papal visits, Izod zoos and Mike after-school basketball programs, everything from small

community events to large religious gatherings are believed to "need a sponsor" to get off the
ground; August 1999, for instance, saw the first-ever private wedding with corporate sponsorship.
This is what Leslie Savan, author of The Sponsored Life, describes as symptom number one of the
sponsored mindset: we become collectively convinced not that corporations are hitching a ride on
our cultural and communal activities, but that creativity and congregation would be impossible
without their generosity.

The expansive trajectory of branding revealed itself to Londoners in a 1997 holiday season morality
play. It began when the Regent Street Association found itself without enough money to replace the
dimming Christmas lights that normally adorned the street during the season. Yves Saint Laurent
stepped in and generously offered to split the cost of new decorations in exchange for seeing its
logo up in lights. But when the time came to hang the Christmas lights, it seemed that the YSL
logos were much larger than the agreed-upon size. Every few steps, shoppers were reminded by
illuminated signs 5.5 meters high just who had brought them Christmas. The logos were eventually
replaced with smaller ones, but the lesson remained: the role of the sponsor, like that of advertising
in general, has a tendency to expand.
While yesterday's corporate sponsors may have been satisfied merely propping up community
events, the meaning-seeking brand builders will never accept this role for long. Branding is, at its
core, a deeply competitive undertaking in which brands are up against not only their immediate
rivals (Mike vs. Reebok, Coke vs. Pepsi, McDonald's vs. Burger King, for example) but all other
brands in the mediascape, including the events and people they are sponsoring. This is perhaps
branding's crudest irony: most manufacturers and retailers begin by seeking out authentic scenes,
important causes and cherished public events so that these things will infuse their brands with
meaning. Such gestures are frequently motivated by genuine admiration and generosity. Too often,
however, the expansive nature of the branding process ends up causing the event to be usurped,
creating the quintessential lose-lose situation. Mot only do fans begin to feel a sense of alienation
from (if not outright resentment toward) once-cherished cultural events, but the sponsors lose what
they need most: a feeling of authenticity with which to associate their brands.
That's certainly what happened to Michael Chesney, the hip-hop adman who painted Canadian
billboards into the branding era. He loved Toronto's Queen Street West —the funky clothing stores,
the artists on all the patios, and, most of all, the graffiti art that figured large on the walls in that
part of town. For Chesney, it was a short step from the public's growing interest in the cultural
value of graffiti to the commercial takeover of that pocket of marginal space — a space used and
reused by the disenfranchised for political and cultural expression in every city in the world.
From the start, Chesney considered himself a distant relative of the graffiti kids — though less a
cousin than a rich uncle. The way he saw it, as a commercial artist and billboard salesman he was
also a creature of the streets, because even if he was painting for corporate clients, he, like the
graffiti artists, left his mark on walls. It was in this context that Chesney pioneered the advertising
practice of the "building takeover." In the late eighties, Chesney's company Murad began painting
directly onto building walls, letting the size of each structure dictate the dimensions of the ad. The
idea harked back to 1920s Coca-Cola murals on corner grocery stores and to early-industrial urban
factories and department stores that painted their names and logos in giant block lettering on their

buildings' facades. The walls Chesney rented to Coke, Warner Brothers and Calvin Klein were a
little bit bigger, however, reaching their pinnacle at a colossal 20,000-square-foot billboard
overlooking one of Toronto's busiest intersections. Gradually, the ads wrapped around the corners
of the buildings so that they covered not just one wall, but all of them: the ad as edifice.
In the summer of 1996, when Levi Strauss chose Toronto to test-market its new SilverTab jeans
line, Chesney put on his most daring show yet: he called it "The Queen Street Takeover." Between
1996 and 1997, Levi's increased its spending on billboard advertisements by a startling 301 percent
— and Toronto saw much of that windfall. For one year, as the centrepiece of the most expensive
outdoor ad campaign in Canadian history, Chesney painted his beloved strip silver. He bought up
the facades of almost every building on the busiest stretch of Queen and turned them into Levi's
billboards, upping the ante of the ad extravaganza even further with 3-D extensions, mirrors and
neon. It was Murad's greatest triumph, but the takeover presented some problems for Michael
Chesney. When I spent a day with him at the tail end of the SilverTab bonanza, he could barely
walk down Queen Street without running into somebody who was furious about the invasion. After
ducking a few bullets, he told me a story of bumping into an acquaintance: "she said, 'You took
over Queen Street.' She was really almost crying and I just, my heart sank, and she was really
bummed out. But, hey, what can you do? It's the future, it's not Queen anymore."
Nearly every major city has seen some variation of the 3-D ad takeover, if not on entire buildings,
then on buses, streetcars or taxis. It is sometimes difficult, however, to express dissatisfaction with
this brand expansion — after all, most of these venues and vehicles have been carrying some form
of advertising for decades. But somewhere along the line, the order flipped. Now buses, streetcars
and taxis, with the help of digital imaging and large pieces of adhesive vinyl, have become ads on
wheels, shepherding passengers around in giant chocolate bars and gum wrappers, just as Hilfiger
and Polo turned clothing into wearable brand billboards.
If this creeping ad expansion seems a mere matter of semantics when applied to taxis and T-shirts,
its implications are much more serious when looked at in the context of another marketing trend:
the branding of entire neighbourhoods and cities. In March 1999, Los Angeles mayor Richard
Riordan unveiled a plan to revitalize poor inner-city areas, many of them still scarred from the 1992
riots after the Rodney King verdict: corporations would adopt a run-down part of town and brand
its redevelopment. For the time being, the sponsors of Genesis LA, as the project is called - among
them Bank-America and Wells Fargo & Co. — only have the option of seeing these sites named
after them, much like a sponsored sports arena. But if the initiative follows the expansive branding
trajectory seen elsewhere, the sponsoring companies could well wield more politically powerful
roles in these communities soon.
The idea of a fully privatized, branded town or neighbourhood is not nearly as far-fetched today as
it was only a few years ago, as the inhabitants of Disney's town Celebration, Florida, can attest —
and as the citizens of Cashmere, Washington, have quickly learned. A sleepy town of 2,500 people,
Cashmere has as its major industry the Liberty Orchard candy factory, which has been making
Aplets and Collets chewy sweets since it was founded in 1918. It was all very quaint until Liberty
Orchard announced in September 1997 that it would leave for greener pastures unless the town
agreed to transform itself into a 3-D tourist attraction for the Aplets and Cotlets all-American brand,
complete with signs along the highway and a downtown turned into a corporate gift shop. The Wall
Street Journal reported the company's ransom demands:

They want all road signs and official correspondence by the city to say "Cashmere, Home of Aplets and Cotlets." They
have asked that one of the two main streets in town be changed to Cotlets Avenue, and the other one be renamed Aplets
Avenue. The candy maker also wants the Mayor and Council to sell City Hall to them, build new parking lots and
possibly go to the bond market to start a tourism campaign on behalf of the worldwide headquarters of a company that
says its story is "America in a nutshell."

Although there is a clear trajectory in all of these stories, there is little point, at this stage in our
sponsored history, in pining for either a mythic brand-free past or some Utopian commercial-free
future. Branding becomes troubling —as it did in the cases just discussed —when the balance tips
dramatically in favour of the sponsoring brand, stripping the hosting culture of its inherent value
and treating it as little more than a promotional tool.
It is possible, however, for a more
balanced relationship to unfold —one in which both sponsor and sponsored hold on to their power
and in which clear boundaries are drawn and protected. As a working journalist, I know that
critical, independent — even Anticorporate — coverage does appear in corporate-owned media,
sandwiched, no less, between the car and tobacco ads. Are these articles tainted by this impure
context? No doubt. But if balance (as opposed to purity) is the goal, then maybe print media, where
the first mass-market advertising campaigns began, can hold some important lessons for how to
cope with the expansionist agenda of branding.
“I appeal to every producer not to release “sponsored” moving pictures … Believe me, if you jam advertising down
their throats and pack their eyes and ears with it, you will build up a resentment that will in time damm your business.
– Carl Laemmle or Universal Pictures, 1931

It is common knowledge that many advertisers rail at controversial content, pull their ads when they
are criticized even slightly and perpetually angle for so-called value-addeds —plugs for their wares
in shopping guides and fashion spreads. For example, S.C. Johnson & Co. stipulates that its ads in
women's magazines "should not be opposite extremely controversial features or material
antithetical to the nature/copy of the advertised product" while De Beers’s diamonds demands that
their ads be far from any "hard news or anti/love-romance themed editorial." And up until 1997,
when Chrysler placed an ad it demanded that it be "alerted in advance of any and all editorial
content that encompasses sexual, political, social issues or any editorial that might be construed as
provocative or offensive." But the advertisers don't always get their way: controversial stories make
it to print and to air, even ones critical of major advertisers. At its most daring and uncompromised,
the news media can provide workable models for the protection of the public interest even under
heavy corporate pressure, though these battles are often won behind closed doors. On the other
hand, at their worst, these same media show how deeply distorting the effects of branding can be on
our public discourse — particularly since journalism, like every other part of our culture, is under
constantly increasing pressure to merge with the brands.
Part of this stepped-up pressure is coming from the explosion of sponsored media projects:
magazines, Web sites and television programs that invite corporate sponsors to become involved at
the development stage of a venture. That's the role Heineken played in the British music and youth
culture show Hotel Babylon, which aired on 1TV. In an embarrassing incident in January 1996, a
memo from a Heineken executive was leaked to the press that berated the producers for
insufficiently "Heineken-izing" the as-yet-unaired program. Specifically, Justus Kos objected to
male audience members drinking wine as opposed to "masculine drinks like beer, whisky," noted

that "more evidence of beer is not just requested but needed" and complained that the show's host
"shouldn't stand in the way of the beer columns when introducing guests." Most inflammatory of all
was the executive's complaint that there was "too high a proportion of negroes in the audience."
After the controversy made its way into the press, Heineken CEO Karel Vuursteen issued a public
apology.
Another sponsor scandal erupted during the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, when CBS
investigative journalist Roberta Baskin saw her CBS Sports department colleagues reporting on the
games in jackets adorned with bold Nike logos. Nike was the official sponsor of the network's
Olympic coverage and it provided news and sports reporters with the swooshed gear because,
according to Nike spokesman Lee Weinstein, it "helps us build awareness about our products."
Baskin was "dismayed and embarrassed" that CBS reporters seemed to be endorsing Nike products,
not only because it represented a further dissolution of the line between editorial and advertising,
but because two years earlier, Baskin had broken a news story about physical abuse of workers at a
Nike shoe factory in Vietnam. She accused the station of refusing to allow her to pursue a followup and of yanking the original story from a scheduled rerun because of its sponsorship deal with
Nike. CBS News president Andrew Heyward strenuously denied bowing to sponsor pressure,
calling Baskin's allegations "truly preposterous." He did pull the Nike jackets off the news reporters
midway through the games, though the sports department kept theirs on.
In some ways, these stories are simply pumped-up versions of the same old tug-of-war between
editorial and advertising that journalists have faced for a century and a quarter. Increasingly,
however, corporations aren't just asking editors and producers to become their de facto ad agencies
by dreaming up ways to plug their wares in articles and photo shoots, they are also asking
magazines to become their actual ad agencies, by helping them to create the ads that run in their
magazines. More and more magazines are turning their offices into market-research firms and their
readers into focus groups in an effort to provide the most cherished "value-added" they can offer
their clients: highly detailed demographic information about their readership, amassed through
extensive surveys and questionnaires.
In many cases, the magazines then use the readership information to design closely targeted
advertisements for their clients. Details magazine, for instance, designed a twenty-four-page
comic/advertisement strip in October 1997, with products like Hugo Boss cologne and Lee jeans
woven into a story line about the daily adventures of a professional in-line skater. On the page
following each product's extreme cameo, the company's real ad appeared.
The irony of these branding experiments, of course, is that they only seem to make brands more
resentful of the media that host them. Inevitably, the lifestyle brands begin to ask why they need to
attach themselves to someone else's media project in the first place. Why, even after proving they
can integrate into the most stylish and trendiest of magazines, should they be kept at arm's length
or, worse, branded with the word "Advertisement," like the health warnings on packs of cigarettes?
So, with lifestyle magazines looking more and more like catalogs for designers, designer catalogs
have begun to look more and more like magazines: Abercrombie & Fitch, J. Crew, Harry Rosen
and Diesel have all shifted to a storybook format, where characters frolic along sketchily drawn
plotlines.

The merger between media and catalogue reached a new high with the launch of the teen TV drama
Dawson's Creek in January of 1998. Not only did the characters all wear J. Crew clothes, not only
did the windswept, nautical set make them look as if they had stepped off the pages of a J. Crew
catalogue, and not only did the characters spout dialogue like "He looks like he stepped out of a J.
Crew catalogue," but the cast was also featured on the cover of the January J. Crew catalogue.
Inside the new "freestyle magalog," the young actors are pictured in rowboats and on docks-looking
as if they just stepped off the set of a Dawson's Creek episode.
To see the birthplace of this kind of brand ambition, you have to go online, where there was never
really any pretence of a wall existing between editorial and advertisement. On the Web, marketing
language reached its nirvana: the ad-free ad. For the most part, the on-line versions of media outlets
feature straightforward banner ads similar to their paper or broadcast versions, but many media
outlets have also used the Met to blur the line between editorial and advertising much more
aggressively than they could in the non-virtual world. For instance, on the Teen People site, readers
can click and order cosmetics and clothing as they read about them. On the Entertainment Weekly
site, visitors can click and order the books and CDs being reviewed. In Canada, The Globe and
Mail has attracted the ire of independent booksellers for the on-line version of its book review
section, ChaptersGLOBE.com. After reading Globe reviews, readers can click to order books
directly from the Chapters chain — a reviewer/retailer partnership that formed "Canada's largest
online bookstore." The New York Times' on-line partnership with Barnes and Noble has caused
similar controversies in the U.S.
These sites are relatively tame examples of the branding-content integration taking place on the
Net, however. Sites are increasingly created by "content developers," whose role is to produce
editorial that will make an ad-cozy home for the developers' brand-name clients. One such on-line
venture is Parent Soup, invented by content developer "iVillage" for Fisher-Price, Starbucks,
Procter and Gamble and Polaroid. It calls itself a "parents' community" and attempts to imitate a
user-driven newsgroup, but when parents go to Parent Soup to get peer advice, they receive such
branded wisdom as: the way to improve your child's self-esteem is by taking Polaroid’s of her. No
need to bully or buy off editors -just publish do-it-yourself content, with ads pre-integrated.
Absolut Vodka's 1997 Absolut Kelly Internet site provided an early preview of the direction in
which branded media are headed. The distiller had long since solicited original, brand-centred
creations from visual artists, fashion designers and novelists to use in its advertisements — but this
was different. On Absolut Kelly, only the name of the site advertised the product; the rest was an
illustrated excerpt from Wired magazine editor Kevin Kelly's book Out of Control. This, it seemed,
was what the brand managers had aspired to all along: for their brands to become quietly integrated
into the heart of the culture. Sure, manufacturers will launch noisy interruptions if they are locked
on the wrong side of the commerce/culture divide, but what they really want is for their brand to
earn the right to be accepted, not just as advertising art but simply as art. Off-line, Absolut is still a
major advertiser in Wired, but on-line, it is Absolut that is the host, and a Wired editor the
supporting act.
Rather than merely bankrolling someone else's content, all over the Net, corporations are
experimenting with the much-coveted role of being "content providers": Gap's site offers travel tips,
Volkswagen provides free music samples, Pepsi urges visitors to download video games, and
Starbucks offers an on-line version of its magazine, Joe. Every brand with a Web site has its own

virtual, branded media outlet —a beachhead from which to expand into other non-virtual media.
What has become clear is that corporations aren't just selling their products on-line; they're selling a
new model for the media's relationship with corporate sponsors and backers. The Internet, because
of its anarchic nature, has created the space for this model to be realized swiftly, but the results are
clearly made for off-line export. For instance, about a year after the launch of Absolut Kelly, the
company reached full editorial integration in Saturday Night magazine when the final page of a
nine-page excerpt from Mordecai Richler's novel Barney's Version was wrapped around the
silhouette of an Absolut bottle. This was not an ad, it was part of the story, yet at the bottom of the
page were the words
"Absolut Mordecai."
Although magazines and individual television shows are beginning to see the branded light, it is a
network, MTV, that is the model for fully branded media integration. MTV started out sponsored,
as a joint venture between Warner Communications and American Express. From the beginning,
MTV has not been just a marketing machine for the products it advertises around the clock
(whether those products are skin cleansers or the albums it moves with its music videos); it has also
been a twenty-four-hour advertisement for MTV itself: the first truly branded network. Though
there have been dozens of imitators since, the original genius of MTV, as every marketer will tell
you, is that viewers didn't watch individual shows, they simply watched MTV. "As far as we were
concerned, MTV was the star," says Tom Freston, network founder. And so advertisers didn't want
to just advertise on MTV, they wanted to co-brand with the station in ways that are still
unimaginable on most other networks: giveaways, contests, movies, concerts, awards ceremonies,
clothing, countdowns, listings, credit cards and more.
The model of the medium-as-brand that MTV perfected has since been adopted by almost every
other major media outlet, whether magazines, film studios, television networks or individual shows.
The hip-hop magazine Vibe has extended into television, fashion shows and music seminars. Fox
Sports has announced that it wants its new line of men's clothing to be on par with Nike: "We are
hoping to take the attitude and lifestyle of Fox Sports off the TV and onto men's backs, creating a
nation of walking billboards," said David Hill, CEO of Fox Broadcasting.
The rush to branding has been most dramatic in the film industry. At the same time that brandname product placement in films has become an indispensable marketing vehicle for companies
like Nike, Macintosh and Starbucks, films themselves are increasingly being conceptualized as
"branded media properties." Newly merged entertainment conglomerates are always looking for
threads to sew together their disparate holdings in cross-promotional webs and, for the most part,
that thread is the celebrity generated by Hollywood blockbusters. Films create stars to crosspromote in books, magazines and TV, and they also provide prime vehicles for sports, television
and music stars to "extend" their own brands.
I'll explore the cultural legacy of this type of synergy-driven production in Chapter 9, but there is a
more immediate impact as well, one that has much to do with the phenomenon of disappearing
unmarketed cultural "space" with which this section is concerned. With brand managers
envisioning themselves as sensitive culture makers, and culture makers adopting the hard-nosed
business tactics of brand builders, a dramatic change in mindset has occurred. Whatever desire
might exist to protect a television show from too much sponsor interference, an emerging musical

genre from crass commercialism or a magazine from overt advertiser control has been trampled by
the manic branding imperative: to disseminate one's own brand "meaning" through whatever means
necessary, often in partnership with other powerful brands. In this context, the Dawson's Creek
brand actively benefits from its exposure in the J. Crew catalogue, the Kelly brand grows stronger
from its association with the Absolut brand, the People magazine brand draws cachet from a close
association with Tommy Hilfiger, and the Phantom Menace tie-ins with Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried
Chicken and Pepsi are invaluable Star Wars brand promotion. When brand awareness is the goal
shared by all, repetition and visibility are the only true measures of success. The journey to this
point of full integration between ad and art, brand and culture, has taken most of this century to
achieve, but the point of no return, when it arrived, was unmistakable: April 1998, the launch of the
Gap Khakis campaign.

]7^_a`bj+dk/	edcªf?­¯s?nA	-w
In 1993, the Gap launched its "Who wore khakis?" ads, featuring old photographs of such
counterculture figures as James Dean and Jack Kerouac in beige pants. The campaign was in the
cookie-cutter co-optation formula: take a cool artist, associate that mystique with your brand, hope
it wears off and makes you cool too. It sparked the usual debates about the mass marketing of
rebellion, just as William Burroughs's presence in a Nike ad did at around the same time.
Fast forward to 1998. The Gap launches its breakthrough Khakis Swing ads: a simple, exuberant
miniature music video set to "Jump, Jive 'n' Wail" — and a great video at that. The question of
whether these ads were "co-opting" the artistic integrity of the music was entirely meaningless. The
Gap's commercials didn't capitalize on the retro swing revival — a solid argument can be made that
they caused the swing revival. A few months later, when singer-songwriter Rufus Wainwright
appeared in a Christmas-themed Gap ad, his sales soared, so much so that his record company
began promoting him as "the guy in the Gap ads." Macy Gray, the new R&B "It Girl," also got her
big break in a Baby Gap ad. And rather than the Gap Khaki ads looking like rip-offs of MTV
videos, it seemed that overnight, every video on MTV —from Brandy to Britney Spears and the
Backstreet Boys —looked like a Gap ad; the company has pioneered its own aesthetic, which
spilled out into music, other advertisements, even films like The Matrix. After five years of intense
lifestyle branding, the Gap, it has become clear, is as much in the culture-creation business as the
artists in its ads.
For their part, many artists now treat companies like the Gap less as deep-pocketed pariahs trying to
feed off their cachet than as just another medium they can exploit in order to promote their own
brands, alongside radio, video and magazines. "We have to be everywhere. We can't afford to be
too precious in our marketing," explains Ron Shapiro, executive vice president of Atlantic Records.
Besides, a major ad campaign from Nike or the Gap penetrates more nooks and crannies of the
culture than a video in heavy rotation on MTV or a cover article in Rolling Stone. Which is why
piggybacking on these campaign blitzes-Fat Boy Slim in Nike ads, Brandy in Cover Girl
commercials, Lil' Kim rapping for Candies —has become, Business Week announced with much
glee, "today's top 40 radio."
Of course the branding of music is not a story of innocence lost. Musicians have been singing ad
jingles and signing sponsorship deals since radio's early days, as well as having their songs played
on commercial radio stations and signing deals with multinational record companies. Throughout

the eighties — music's decade of the straight-up shill — rock stars like Eric Clapton sang in beer
ads, and the pop stars, appropriately enough, crooned for pop: George Michael, Robert Plant,
Whitney Houston, Run-DMC, Madonna, Robert Palmer, David Bowie, Tina Turner, Lionel Richie
and Ray Charles all did Pepsi or Coke ads, while sixties anthems like the Beatles' "Revolution"
became background music for Nike commercials.
During this same period, the Rolling Stones made music history by ushering in the era of the
sponsored rock tour —and fittingly, sixteen years later; it is still the Stones who are leading the
charge into the latest innovation in corporate rock: the band as brand extension. In 1981, Jovan —a
distinctly un-rock-and-roll perfume company — sponsored a Rolling Stones stadium tour, the first
arrangement of its kind, though tame by today's standards. Though the company got its logos on a
few ads and banners, there was a clear distinction between the band that had chosen to "sell out"
and the corporation that had paid a huge sum to associate itself with the inherent rebelliousness of
rock. This subordinate status might have been fine for a company out merely to move products, but
when designer Tommy Hilfiger decided that the energy of rock and rap would become his "brand
essence," he was looking for an integrated experience, one more in tune with his own transcendent
identity quest. The results were evident in the Stones' Tommy-sponsored Bridges to Babylon tour
in 1997. Not only did Hilfiger have a contract to clothe Mick Jagger, he also had the same
arrangement with the Stones' opening act, Sheryl Crow — on stage, both modelled items from
Tommy's newly launched "Rock V Roll Collection."
It wasn't until January 1999, however —when Hilfiger launched the ad campaign for the Stones' No
Security Tour - that full brand-culture integration was achieved. In the ads, young, glowing Tommy
models were pictured in full-page frame "watching" a Rolling Stones concert taking place on the
opposite page. The photographs of the band members were a quarter of the size of those of the
models. In some of the ads, the Stones were nowhere to be found and the Tommy models alone
were seen posing with their own guitars. In all cases, the ads featured a hybrid logo of the Stones'
famous red tongue over Tommy's trademarked red-white-and-blue flag. The tagline was "Tommy
Hilfiger Presents the Rolling Stones No Security Tour"-though there were no dates or locations for
any tour stops, only the addresses of flagship Tommy stores.
In other words, this wasn't rock sponsorship; it was "live-action advertising," as media consultant
Michael J. Wolf describes the ads. It's clear from the campaign's design that Hilfiger isn't interested
in buying a piece of someone else's act, even if they are the Rolling Stones. The act is a background
set, powerfully showcasing the true rock-and-roll essence of the Tommy brand; just one piece of
Hilfiger's larger project of cawing out a place in the music world, not as a sponsor but as a player
— much as Nike has achieved in the sports world.
The Hilfiger/Stones branding is only the highest-profile example of the new relationship between
bands and sponsors that is sweeping the music industry. For instance, it was a short step for
Volkswagen — after using cutting-edge electronic music in its ads for the new Beetle — to launch
DriversFest '99, a VW branded music festival in Long Island, New York. DriversFest competes for
ticket sales with the Mentos Freshmaker Tour, a two-year-old travelling music festival owned and
branded by a breath-mint manufacturer — on the Mentos Web site, visitors are invited to vote for
which bands they want to play the venue. As with the Absolut Kelly Web site and the Altoids'
Curiously Strong art exhibition, these are not sponsored events: the brand is the event's

infrastructure; the artists are its filler, a reversal in the power dynamic that makes any discussion of
the need to protect unmarketed artistic space appears hopelessly naive.
This emerging dynamic is clearest in the branded festivals being developed by the large beer
companies. Instead of merely playing in beer ads, as they likely would have in the eighties, acts like
Hole, Soundgarden, David Bowie and the Chemical Brothers now play beer-company gigs. Molson
Breweries, which owns 50 percent of Canada's only national concert promoter, Universal Concerts,
already has its name promoted almost every time a rock or pop star gets up on stage in Canada —
either through its Molson Canadian Rocks promotional arm or its myriad venues: Molson Stage,
Molson Park, Molson Amphitheatre. For the first decade or so, this was a fine arrangement, but by
the mid-nineties, Molson was tired of being upstaged. Rock stars had an annoying tendency to hog
the spotlight and, worse, sometimes they even insulted their sponsors from the stage.
Clearly fed up, in 1996 Molson held its first Blind Date Concert. The concept, which has since been
exported to the U.S. by sister company Miller Beer, is simple: hold a contest in which winners get
to attend an exclusive concert staged by Molson and Miller in a small club — much smaller than
the venues where one would otherwise see these megastars. And here's the clincher: keep the name
of the band secret until it steps on stage. Anticipation mounts about the concert (helped along by
national ad campaigns building up said anticipation), but the name on everyone's lips isn't David
Bowie, the Rolling Stones, Soundgarden, 1NXS or any of the other bands that have played the
Dates, it's Molson and Miller. No one, after all, knows who is going to play, but they know who is
putting on the show. With Blind Date, Molson and Miller invented a way to equate their brands
with extremely popular musicians, while still maintaining their competitive edge over the stars. "In
a funny way," says Universal Concerts' Steve Herman, "the beer is bigger than the band."
The rock stars, turned into high-priced hired guns at Molson's bar mitzvah party, continued to find
sad little ways to rebel. Almost every musician who played a Blind Date acted out: Courtney Love
told a reporter, "God bless Molson.... I douche with it." The Sex Pistols' Johnny Lydon screamed
"Thank you for the money" from the stage, and Soundgarden's Chris Cornell told the crowd, "Yeah,
we're here because of some fucking beer company... Labatt's." But the tantrums were all incidental
to the main event, in which Molson and Miller were the real rock stars and it didn't really matter
how those petulant rent-a-bands behaved.
Jack Rooney, Miller's vice president of marketing, explains that his $200 million promotion budget
goes toward devising creative new ways to distinguish the Miller brand from the plethora of other
brands in the marketplace. "We're competing not just against Coors and Corona," he says, "but
Coke, Nike and Microsoft." Only he isn't telling the whole story. In Advertising Age's annual "Top
Marketing 100" list of 1997's best brands there was a new arrival: the Spice Girls (fittingly enough,
since Posh Spice did once tell a reporter, "We wanted to be a 'household name'. Like Ajax.") And
the Spice Girls ranked number six in Forbes magazine's inaugural "Celebrity Power 100," in May
1999, a new ranking based not on fame or fortune but on stars' brand "franchise." The list was a
watershed moment in corporate history, marking the fact that, as Michael J. Wolf says, "Brands and
stars have become the same thing."
But when brands and stars are the same thing, they are also, at times, competitors in the high-stakes
tussle for brand awareness, a fact more consumer companies have become ready to admit. Canadian
clothing company Club Monaco, for instance, has never used celebrities in its campaigns. "We've

thought about it," says vice president Christine Ralphs, "but whenever we go there, it always
becomes more about the personality than the brand, and for us, we're just not willing to share that."
There is good reason to be protective: though more and more clothing and candy companies seem
intent on turning musicians into their opening acts, bands and their record labels are launching their
own challenges to this demoted status. After seeing the enormous profits that the Gap and Tommy
Hilfiger have made through their association with the music world, record labels are barrelling into
the branding business themselves. Mot only are they placing highly sophisticated cross-branding
apparatus behind working musicians, but bands are increasingly being conceived — and testmarketed — as brands first: the Spice Girls, the Backstreet Boys, 1M' Sync, All Saints and so on.
Prefab bands aren't new to the music industry, and neither are bands with their own merchandising
lines, but the phenomenon has never dominated pop culture as it has at the end of the nineties, and
musicians have never before competed so aggressively with consumer brands. Sean "Puffy" Combs
has leveraged his celebrity as a rapper and record producer into a magazine, several restaurants, a
clothing label and a line of frozen foods. And Raekwon, of the rap group Wu-Tang Clan, explains
that "the music, movies, the clothing, it is all part of the pie we're making. In the year 2005 we
might have Wu-Tang furniture for sale at Nordstrom." Whether it's the Gap or Wu-Tang Clan, the
only remaining relevant question in the sponsorship debate seems to be, where do you have the guts
to draw the borders around your brand?

Inevitably, any discussion about branded celebrity leads to the same place: Michael Jordan, the man
who occupies the number-one spot on all of those ranking lists, who has incorporated himself into
the JORDAN brand, whose agent coined the term "superbrand" to describe him. But no discussion
of Michael Jordan's brand potential can begin without the brand that branded him: Nike. Nike has
successfully upstaged sports on a scale that makes the breweries' rock-star aspirations look like
amateur night. Now of course pro sports, like big-label music, is in essence a profit-driven
enterprise, which is why the Nike story has less to teach us about the loss of unmarketed space —
space that, arguably, never even existed in this context —than it does about the mechanics of
branding and its powers of eclipse. A company that swallows cultural space in giant gulps, Nike is
the definitive story of the transcendent nineties superbrand, and more than any other single
company, its actions demonstrate how branding seeks to erase all boundaries between the sponsor
and the sponsored. This is a shoe company that is determined to unseat pro sports, the Olympics
and even star athletes, to become the very definition of sports itself.
Nike CEO Phil Knight started selling running shoes in the sixties, but he didn't strike it rich until
high-tech sneakers became the must-have accessory of America's jogging craze. But when jogging
subsided in the mid-eighties and Reebok cornered the market on trendy aerobics shoes, Nike was
left with a product destined for the great dustbin of yuppie fads. Rather than simply switching to a
different kind of sneaker, Knight decided that running shoes should become peripheral in a
reincarnated Nike. Leave sneakers to Reebok and Adidas-Nike would transform itself into what
Knight calls "the world's best sports and Fitness Company."

The corporate mythology has it that Nike is a sports and fitness company because it was built by a
bunch of jocks who loved sports and were fanatically devoted to the worship of superior athletes. In
reality, Nike's project was a little more complicated and can be separated into three guiding
principles. First, turn a select group of athletes into Hollywood-style superstars who are associated
not with their teams or even, at times, with their sport, but instead with certain pure ideas about
athleticism as transcendence and perseverance — embodiments of the Greco-Roman ideal of the
perfect male form. Second, pit Nike's "Pure Sports" and its team of athletic superstars against the
rule-obsessed established sporting world. Third, and most important, brand like mad.

I wake up every morning, jump in the shower, look down at the symbol, and that pumps me up for
the day. It's to remind me every day what I have to do, which is, "Just Do It."
-Twenty-four-year-old Internet entrepreneur Carmine Collettion on his decision to get a Nike
swoosh tattooed on his navel, December 1997
It was Michael Jordan's extraordinary basketball skill that catapulted Nike to branded heaven, but it
was Mike's commercials that made Jordan a global superstar. It's true that gifted athletes like Babe
Ruth and Muhammad Ali were celebrities before Mike's time, but they never reached Jordan's
otherworldly level of fame. That stratum was reserved for movie and pop stars, which had been
transformed by the special effects, art direction and careful cinematography of films and music
videos. Sport stars pre-Mike, no matter how talented or worshiped, were still stuck on the ground.
Football, hockey and baseball may have been ubiquitous on television, but televised sports were
just real-time play-by-plays, which were often tedious, sometimes exciting and high tech only in
the slow-mo replay. As for athletes endorsing products, their advertisements and commercials
couldn't quite be described as cutting-edge star creation — whether it was Wilt Chamberlain
goofily grinning from a box of Wheaties or Rocket Richard being sentenced to "two minutes for
looking so good" in Grecian Formula commercials.
I wake up every morning, jump in the shower, look down at the symbol, and that pumps me up for the day.
It’s to remind me every day what I have to do, which is, “Just Do It.” – Twenty four year old Internet
entrepreneur Carmine Collecttion on his decision to get a Nike swoosh tattooed on his navel, December
1997.

Mike's 1985 TV spots for Michael Jordan brought sports into the entertainment world: the freeze
frame, the close-up and the quick cuts that allowed Jordan to appear to be suspended in mid-jump,
providing the stunning illusion that he could actually take flight. The idea of harnessing sport-shoe
technology to create a superior being — of Michael Jordan flying through the air in suspended
animation — was Mike mythmaking at work. These commercials were the first rock videos about
sports and they created something entirely new. As Michael Jordan says, "What Phil [Knight] and
Mike have done is turn me into a dream."
Many of Mike's most famous TV commercials have used Nike superstars to convey the idea of
sports, as opposed to simply representing the best of the athlete's own team sport. Spots often

feature famous athletes playing a game other than the one they play professionally, such as tennis
pro Andre Agassi showing off his version of "rock-and-roll golf." And then there was the
breakthrough "Bo Knows" campaign, which lifted baseball and football player Bo Jackson out of
his two professional sports and presented him instead as the perfect all-around cross-trainer. A
series of quick-cut interviews with Mike stars —McEnroe, Jordan, Gretzky — ironically suggested
that Jackson knew their sports better than they did. "Bo knows tennis," "Bo knows basketball" and
so on.
At the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Mike took this strategy out of the controlled environment
of its TV commercials and applied it to a real sports competition. The experiment started in 1995
when Mike's marketing department dreamed up the idea of turning a couple of Kenyan runners into
Africa's first Olympic ski team. As Mark Bossardet, Mike's director of global athletics, explained,
"We were sitting around the office one day and we said, 'What if we took Kenyan runners and
transferred their skills to cross-country skiing?'" Kenyan runners, who have dominated crosscountry track-and-field competitions at the Olympics since 1968, have always represented the "idea
of sports" at Mike headquarters. ("Where's the Kenyans running?" Phil Knight has been heard to
demand after viewing a Mike ad deemed insufficiently inspiring and heroic. In Mike shorthand it
means, "Where's the Spirit of Sports?"). So according to Mike marketing logic, if two Kenyan
runners -living specimens of sports incarnate —were plucked out of their own sport and out of their
country and their native climate, and dumped on a frozen mountaintop, and if they were then able
to transfer their agility, strength and endurance to cross-country skiing, their success would
represent a moment of pure sporting transcendence. It would be a spiritual transformation of Man
over nature, birthright, nation and petty sports bureaucrats — brought to the world by Mike, of
course. "Mike always felt sports shouldn't have boundaries," the swooshed press release announced.
Finally there would be proof.
And if nothing else, Mike would get its name in lots of quirky human-interest sidebar stories—just
like the wacky Jamaican bobsled team that hogged the headlines at the 1988 Winter Olympics in
Calgary. What sports reporter could resist the heart-warmer of Africa's first ski team?
Mike found its test-tube subjects in two mid-level runners, Philip Boit and Henry Bitok. Since
Kenya has no snow, no ski federation and no training facilities, Nike financed the entire extravagant
affair, dishing out $250,000 for training in Finland and custom-designed uniforms, and paying the
runners a salary to live away from their families. When Nagano rolled around, Bitok didn't qualify
and Boit finished last-a full twenty minutes after the gold-medal winner, Bjorn Daehlie of Norway.
It turns out that cross-country running and cross-country skiing — despite the similarity of their
names — require entirely different sets of skills and use different muscles.
But that was beside the point. Before the race began, Nike held a press conference at its Olympic
headquarters, catered the event with Kenyan food and beer and showed reporters a video of the
Kenyans encountering snow for the first time, skiing into bushes and falling on their butts. The
journalists also heard accounts of how the climate change was so dramatic that the Kenyans' skin
cracked and their fingernails and toenails fell off, but "now," as Boit said, "I love snow. Without
snow, 1 could not do my sport." As the Tampa Tribune of February 12, 1998, put it, "They're just
two kooky Kenyans trying to make it in the frozen tundra."

It was quintessential Nike branding: by equating the company with athletes and athleticism at such
a primal level, Nike ceased merely to clothe the game and started to play it. And once Nike was in
the game with its athletes, it could have fanatical sports fans instead of customers.

Like any competitive sports player, Nike has its work cut out for it: winning. But winning for Nike
is about much more than sneaker wars. Of course Nike can't stand Adidas, Fila and Reebok, but
more important, Phil Knight has sparred with sports agents, whose individual greed, he claims, puts
them "inherently in conflict with the interests of athletes at every turn"; the NBA, which he feels
has unfairly piggybacked on Nike's star-creation machinery; and the International Olympic
Committee, whose elitism and corruption Knight derided long before the organization's 1999
bribery scandals. In Nike's world, all of the official sports clubs, associations and committees are
actually trampling the spirit of sports — a spirit Nike alone truly embodies and appreciates.
So at the same time as Nike's myth machine was fabricating the idea of Team Nike, Nike's
corporate team was dreaming up ways to play a more central role in pro sports. First Nike tried to
unseat the sports agents by starting an agency of its own, not only to represent athletes in contract
negotiation but also to develop integrated marketing strategies for its clients that are sure to
complement —not dilute —Nike's own branding strategy, often by pushing its own ad concepts on
other companies.
Then there was a failed attempt to create — and own — a college football version of the Super
Bowl (the Nike Bowl), and in 1992, Nike did buy the Ben Hogan golf tour and rename it the Nike
Tour. "We do these things to be in the sport. We're in sports — that's what we do," Knight told
reporters at the time. That is certainly what they did when Nike and rival Adidas made up their own
sporting event to settle a grudge match over who could claim the title "fastest man alive" in their
ads: Nike's Michael Johnson or Adidas's Donovan Bailey. Because the two compete in different
categories (Bailey in the 100-meter, Johnson in the 200), the sneaker brands agreed to split the
difference and had the men compete in a made-up 150-meter race. Adidas won.
When Phil Knight faces the inevitable criticism from sports purists that he is having an undue
influence on the games he sponsors, his stock response is that "the athlete remains our reason for
being." But as the company's encounter with star basketball player Shaquille O'Neal shows, Nike is
only devoted to a certain kind of athlete. Company biographer Donald Katz describes the tense
meeting between O'NeaFs manager, Leonard Armato, and Nike's marketing team:
Shaq had observed the explosion of the sports-marketing scene ("He took sports-marketing
courses," Armato says) and the rise of Michael Jordan, and he'd decided that rather than becoming
a part of several varied corporate marketing strategies, an array of companies might be assembled
as part of a brand presence that was he. Consumer products companies would become part of
Team Shaq, rather than the other way around. "We're looking for consistency of image," Armato
would say as he began collecting the team on Shaq's behalf. "Like Mickey Mouse."
The only problem was that at Nike headquarters, there is no Team Shaq, only Team Nike. Nike
took a pass and handed over the player many thought would be the next Michael Jordan to Reebok
—not "Nike material," they said. According to Katz, Knight's mission "from the beginning had

been to build a pedestal for sports such as the world had never seen." But at Nike Town in
Manhattan, the pedestal is not holding up Michael Jordan, or the sport of basketball, but a rotating
Nike sneaker. Like a prima Donna, it sits in the spotlight, the first celebrity shoe.

Eg_¬¶µh³_}}/·S	e_3w_3n+fhg^?_\`9j+d<k¸©n¹9fh¹%g<uºj+ng$^_7`b_3B}O	-d{uºjJ}«}
Nothing embodies the era of the brand like Nike Town, the company's chain of flagship retail
outlets. Each one is a shrine, a place set apart for the faithful, a mausoleum. The Manhattan Nike
Town on East Fifty-seventh Street is more than a fancy store fitted with the requisite brushed
chrome and blond wood, it is a temple, where the swoosh is worshiped as both art and heroic
symbol. The swoosh is equated with Sports at every turn: in reverent glass display cases depicting
"The definition of an athlete"; in the inspirational quotes about "Courage," "Honour," "Victory" and
"Teamwork" inlaid in the floorboards; and in the building's dedication "to all athletes and their
dreams."
I asked a salesperson if there was anything amid the thousands of T-shirts, bathing suits, sports bras
or socks that did not have a Nike logo on the outside of the garment. He racked his brain. T-shirts,
no. Shoes, no. Track suits? No.
"Why?" he finally asked, sounding a bit hurt. "Is somebody allergic to the swoosh?"
Nike, king of the superbrands, is like an inflated Pac-Man, so driven to consume it does so not out
of malice but out of jaw-clenching reflex. It is ravenous by nature. It seems fitting that Nike's
branding strategy involves an icon that looks like a check mark. Nike is checking off the spaces as
it swallows them: superstores? Check. Hockey? Baseball? Soccer? Check. Check. Check. T-shirts?
Check. Hats? Check. Underwear? Check. Schools? Bathrooms? Shaved into brush cuts? Check.
Check. Check. Since Nike has been the leader in branding clothing, it's not surprising that it has
also led the way to the brand's final frontier: the branding of flesh. Not only do dozens of Nike
employees have a swoosh tattooed on their calves, but tattoo parlours all over North America report
that the swoosh has become their most popular item. Human branding? Check.

]7^_a`bj+dk_3k»Eg$j+
There is another reason behind Nike's stunning success at disseminating its brand. The superstar
athletes who form the building blocks of its image — those creatures invented by Nike and cloned
by Adidas and Fila — have proved uniquely positioned to soar in the era of synergy: they are made
to be cross-promoted. The Spice Girls can make movies, and film stars can walk the runways but
neither can quite win an Olympic medal. It's more practical for Dennis Rodman to write two books,
star in two movies and have his own television show than it is for Martin Amis or Seinfeld to play
defence for the Bulls, just as it is easier for Shaquille O'Neal to put out a rap album than it is for
Sporty Spice to make the NBA draft. Only animated characters — another synergy favourite — are
more versatile than sports stars in the synergy game.
But for Nike, there is a downside to the power of its own celebrity endorsers. Though Phil Knight
will never admit it, Nike is no longer just competing with Reebok, Adidas and the NBA; it has also
begun to compete with another brand: its name is Michael Jordan.

In the three years before he retired, Jordan was easing away from his persona as Nike incarnate and
turning himself into what his agent, David Falk, calls a "superbrand." He refused to go along when
Nike entered the sports-agent business, telling the company that it would have to compensate him
for millions of dollars in lost revenue. Instead of letting Nike manage his endorsement portfolio, he
tried to build synergy deals between his various sponsors, including a bizarre attempt to persuade
Nike to switch phone companies when he became a celebrity spokesperson for WorldCom. Other
highlights of what Falk terms "Michael Jordan's Corporate Partnership Program" include a
WorldCom commercial in which the actors are decked out in Oakley sunglasses and Wilson sports
gear, both Jordan-endorsed products. And, of course, the movie Space Jam — in which the
basketball player starred and which Falk executive-produced — was Jordan's coming-out party as
his own brand. The movie incorporated plugs for each of Jordan's sponsors (choice dialogue
includes "Michael, it's show time. Get your Hanes on, lace up your Nikes, grab your Wheaties and
Gatorade and we'll pick up a Big Mac on the way!"), and McDonald's promoted the event with
Space Jam toys and Happy Meals.
Mike had been playing up Jordan's business ambitions in its "CEO Jordan" commercials, which
show him changing into a suit and racing to his office at halftime. But behind the scenes, the
company has always resented Jordan's extra-Mike activities. Donald Katz writes that as early as
1992, "Knight believed that Michael Jordan was no longer, in sports-marketing nomenclature,
'clean.'" Significantly, Mike boycotted the co-branding bonanza that surrounded Space Jam. Unlike
McDonald's, it didn't use the movie in tie-in commercials, despite the fact that Space Jam is based
on a series of Mike commercials featuring Jordan and Bugs Bunny. When Falk told Advertising
Age that "Mike had some reservations about the implementation of the movie," he was exercising
considerable restraint. Jim Riswold, the long-time Mike adman who first conceived of pairing
Jordan with Bugs Bunny in the shoe commercials, complained to The Wall Street Journal that
Space Jam "is a merchandising bonanza first and a movie second. The idea is to sell lots of
product." It was a historic moment in the branding of culture, completely inverting the traditionally
fraught relationship between art and commerce: a shoe company and an ad agency huffing and
puffing that a Hollywood movie would sully the purity of their commercials.
For the time being at least, a peace has descended between the warring superbrands. Mike has given
Jordan more leeway to develop his own apparel brand, still within the Nike Empire but with greater
independence. In the same week that he retired from basketball, Jordan announced that he would be
extending the JORDAN clothing line from basketball gear into lifestyle wear, competing directly
with Polo, Hilfiger and Nautica. Settling into his role as CEO — as opposed to celebrity endorser
— he signed up other pro athletes to endorse the JORDAN brand: Derek Jeter, a shortstop for the
Mew York Yankees and boxer Roy Jones Jr. And, as of May 1999, the full JORDAN brand is
showcased in its own "retail concept shops" — two in New York and one in Chicago, with plans
for up to fifty outlets by the end of the year 2000. Jordan finally had his wish: to be his own freestanding brand, complete with celebrity endorsers.

On the surface, the power plays between millionaire athletes and billion-dollar companies would
seem to have little to do with the loss of unmarketed space that is the subject of this section. Jordan

and Nike, however, are only the most broad strokes, manifestations of the way in which the
branding imperative changes the way we imagine both sponsor and sponsored to the extent that the
idea of unbranded space — music that is distinct from khakis, festivals that are not extensions of
beer brands, athletic achievement that is celebrated in and of itself—becomes almost unthinkable.
Jordan and Nike are emblematic of a new paradigm that eliminates all barriers between branding
and culture, leaving no room whatsoever for unmarketed space.
An understanding is beginning to emerge that fashion designers, running-shoe companies, media
outlets, cartoon characters and celebrities of all kinds are all more or less in the same business: the
business of marketing their brands. That's why in the early nineties, Creative Artists Agency, the
most powerful celebrity agency in Hollywood, began to represent not just celebrity people, but
celebrity brands: Coke, Apple and even an alliance with Nike. That's why Benetton, Microsoft and
Starbucks have leapfrogged over the "magalog" trend and have gone full force into the magazine
publishing business: Benetton with Colours, Microsoft with the on-line zine Slate and Starbucks
with Joe, a joint venture with Time Inc. That's why teen sensation Britney Spears and sitcom
character Ally McBeal each have their own line of designer clothing; why Tommy Hilfiger has
helped launch a record label; and rapper Master P has his own sports agency business. It's also why
Ralph Lauren has a line of designer household paints, Brooks Brothers has a line of wines, Nike is
set to launch a swooshed cruise ship, and auto-parts giant Magna is opening up an amusement park.
It is also why market consultant Faith Popcorn has launched her own brand of leather Cocooning
armchairs, named after the trend she coined of the same name, and Fashion Licensing of America
Inc. is marketing a line of Ernest Hemingway furniture, designed to capture the "brand personality"
of the late writer.
As manufacturers and entertainers swap roles and move together toward the creation of branded
lifestyle bubbles, Nike executives predict that their "competition in the future [will] be Disney, not
Reebok." And it seems only
fitting that just as Nike enters the entertainment business, the entertainment giants have decided to
try their hand at the sneaker industry. In October 1997, Warner Brothers launched a low-end
basketball shoe, endorsed by Shaquille O'Neal. "It's an extension of what we do at retail," explained
Dan Romanelli of Warner Consumer products.
It seems that wherever individual brands began — in shoes, sports, retail, food, music or cartoons
— the most successful among them have all landed in the same place: the stratosphere of the
superbrand. That is where Mick Jagger struts in Tommy Hilfiger, Steven Spielberg and Coke have
the same agent, Shaq wants to be "like Mickey Mouse," and everyone has his or her own branded
restaurant — from Jordan to Disney to Demi Moore to Puffy Combs and the supermodels.
It was Michael Ovitz, of course, who came up with the blueprint for the highest temple of branding
so far, one that would do for music, sports and fashion what Walt Disney long ago did for kids'
cartoons: turn the slick world of television into a real-world branded environment. After leaving
Creative Artists Agency in August 1995 and being driven out as president of Disney shortly after,
Ovitz took his unprecedented $87 million golden handshake and launched a new venture:
entertainment- and sports-themed mega malls, a synthesis of pro sports, Hollywood celebrity and
shopping. His vision is of an unholy mixture of Nike Town, Planet Hollywood and the NBA's
marketing wing — all leading straight to the cash register. The first venture, a 1.5-million-square-

foot theme mall in Columbus, Ohio, is scheduled to open in the year 2000. If Ovitz gets his way,
another mall, planned for the Los Angeles area, will include an NFL football stadium.
As these edifices of the future suggest, corporate sponsors and the culture they brand have fused
together to create a third culture: a self-enclosed universe of brand-name people, brand-name
products and brand-name media. Interestingly, a 1995 study conducted by University of Missouri
professor Roy F. Fox shows that many kids grasp the unique ambiguities of this sphere intuitively.
The study found that a majority of Missouri high-school students who watched Channel One's mix
of news and ads in their classrooms thought that sports stars paid shoe companies to be in their
commercials.
"I don't know why athletes do that —pay all that money for all them ignorant commercials for
themselves. Guess it makes everyone like 'em more and like their teams more."
So opined Debbie, a ninth-grader and one of the two hundred students who participated in the
study. For Fox, the comment demonstrates a disturbing lack of media literacy, proof positive that
kids can't critically evaluate the advertising they see on television. But perhaps these findings show
that kids understand something most of us still refuse to grasp. Maybe they know that sponsorship
is a far more complicated process than the buyer/ seller dichotomy that existed in previous decades
and that to talk of who sold out or bought in has become impossibly anachronistic. In an era in
which people are brands and brands are culture, what Nike and Michael Jordan do is more akin to
co-branding than straight-up shilling, and while the Spice Girls may be doing Pepsi today, they
could easily launch their own Spice Cola tomorrow.
It makes a good deal of sense that high-school kids would have a more realistic grasp of the
absurdities of branded life. They, after all, are the ones who grew up sold.

CHAPTER THREE
ALT.EVERYTHING

The Youth Market and the Marketing of Cool It's terrible to say; very often the most
exciting outfits are from the poorest people.— Designer Christian Lacroix in Vogue, April
1994
In our final year of high school, my best friend, Lan Ying, and I passed the time with morbid
discussions about the meaninglessness of life when everything had already been done. The world
stretched out before us not as a slate of possibility, but as a maze of well-worn grooves like the
ridges burrowed by insects in hardwood. Step off the straight and narrow career-and-materialism
groove and you just end up on another one — the groove for people who step off the main groove.
And that groove was worn indeed (some of the grooving done by our own parents). Want to go
travelling? Be a modern-day Kerouac? Hop on the Let's Go Europe groove. How about a rebel? An
avant-garde artist? Go buy your alterna-groove at the second-hand bookstore, dusty and moth-eaten
and done to death. Everywhere we imagined ourselves standing turned into a cliché beneath our
feet — the stuff of Jeep ad copy and sketch comedy. To us it seemed as though the archetypes were
all hackneyed by the time our turn came to graduate, including that of the black-clad deflated
intellectual, which we were trying on at that very moment. Crowded by the ideas and styles of the
past, we felt there was no open space anywhere.

Of course it's a classic symptom of teenage narcissism to believe that the end of history coincides
exactly with your arrival on earth. Almost every angst-ridden, Camus-reading seventeen-year-old
girl finds her own groove eventually. Still, there is a part of my high-school globo-claustrophobia
that has never left me, and in some ways only seems to intensify as time creeps along. What haunts
me is not exactly the absence of literal space so much as a deep craving for metaphorical space:
release, escape, some kind of open-ended freedom.
All my parents wanted were the open road and a VW camper. That was enough escape for them.
The ocean, the night sky, and some acoustic guitar... what more could you ask? Well, actually, you
could ask to go soaring off the side of a mountain on a snowboard, feeling as if, for one moment,
you are riding the clouds instead of the snow. You could scour Southeast Asia, like the worldweary twenty-something’s in Alex Garland's novel The Beach, looking for the one corner of the
globe uncharted by the Lonely Planet to start your own private Utopia. You could, for that matter,
join a New Age cult and dream of alien abduction. From the occult to raves to riots to extreme
sports, it seems that the eternal urge for escape has never enjoyed such niche marketing.
In the absence of space travel and confined by the laws of gravity, however, most of us take our
open space where we can get it, sneaking it like cigarettes, outside hulking enclosures. The streets
may be lined with billboards and franchise signs, but kids still make do, throwing up a couple of
nets and passing the puck or soccer ball between the cars. There is release, too, at England's free
music festivals, and in conversions of untended private property into collective space: abandoned
factories turned into squats by street kids or ramped entrances to office towers transformed into
skateboarding courses on Sunday afternoons.
But as privatization slithers into every crevice of public life, even these intervals of freedom and
back alleys of unsponsored space are slipping away. The indie skateboarders and snowboarders all
have Vans sneaker contracts, road hockey is fodder for beer commercials, inner-city redevelopment
projects are sponsored by Wells Fargo, and the free festivals have all been banned, replaced with
the annual Tribal Gathering, an electronic music festival that bills itself as a "strike back against the
establishment and club-land's evil empire of mediocrity, commercialism, and the creeping corporate
capitalism of our cosmic counter-culture"' and where the organizers regularly confiscate bottled
water that has not been purchased on the premises, despite the fact that the number-one cause of
death at raves is dehydration.
I remember the moment when it hit me that my frustrated craving for space wasn't simply a result
of the inevitable march of history, but of the fact that commercial co-optation was proceeding at a
speed that would have been unimaginable to previous generations. I was watching the television
coverage of the controversy surrounding Woodstock '94, the twenty-fifth-anniversary festival of the
original Woodstock event. The baby-boomer pundits and aging rock stars postured about how the
$2 cans of Woodstock Memorial Pepsi, festival key chains and on-site cash machines betrayed the
anticommercial spirit of the original event and, incredibly, whined that the $3 commemorative
condoms marked the end of "free love" (as if AIDS had been cooked up as a malicious affront to
their nostalgia).

What struck me most was that the debate revolved entirely around the sanctity of the past, with no
recognition of present-tense cultural challenges. Despite the fact that the anniversary festival was
primarily marketed to teenagers and college students and showcased then-up-and-coming bands
like Green Day, not a single commentator explored what this youth-culture "commodification"
might mean to the young people who would actually be attending the event. Never mind about the
offence to hippies decades after the fact; how does it feel to have your culture "sold out" now, as
you are living it? The only mention that a new generation of young people even existed came when
the organizers, confronted with charges from ex-hippies that they had engineered Greedstock or
Woodshlock, explained that if the event wasn't shrink-wrapped and synergized, the kids today
would mutiny. Woodstock promoter John Roberts explained that today's youth are "used to
sponsorship. If a kid went to a concert and there wasn't merchandise to buy, he'd probably go out of
his mind."
Roberts isn't the only one who holds this view. Advertising Age reporter Jeff Jensen goes so far as
to make the claim that for today's young people, "Selling out is not only accepted, it's considered
hip.” To object would be, well, unhip. There is no need to further romanticize the original
Woodstock. Among (many) other things, it was also a big-label-backed rock festival, designed to
turn a profit. Still, the myth of Woodstock as a sovereign youth-culture state was part of a vast
project of generational self-definition — a concept that would have been wholly foreign to those in
attendance at Woodstock '94, for whom generational identity had largely been a pre-packaged good
and for whom the search for self had always been shaped by marketing hype, whether or not they
believed it or defined themselves against it. This is a side effect of brand expansion that is far more
difficult to track and quantify than the branding of culture and city spaces. This loss of space
happens inside the individual; it is colonization not of physical space but of mental space.
In a climate of youth-marketing feeding frenzy, all culture begins to be created with the frenzy in
mind. Much of youth culture becomes suspended in what sociologists Robert Goldman and Stephen
Papson call "arrested development," noting that "we have, after all, no idea of what punk or grunge
or hip hop as social and cultural movements might look like if they were not mined for their gold ...
" This "mining" has not gone unnoticed or unopposed. Both the Anticorporate cultural journal The
Baffler and the now-defunct Might magazine brilliantly lampooned the desperation and striving of
the youth-culture industry in the mid-nineties. Dozens, if not hundreds, of zines and Web sites have
been launched and have played no small part in setting the mood for the kind of brand-based
attacks that I chronicle in Part IV of this book. For the most part, however, branding's insatiable
cultural thirst just creates more marketing. Marketing that thinks it is culture.
To understand how youth culture became such a sought-after market in the early nineties, it helps to
go back briefly to the recession era "brand crisis" that took root immediately preceding this frenzy
—a crisis that, with so many consumers failing to live up to corporate expectations, created a clear
and pressing need for a new class of shoppers to step in and take over.
During the two decades before the brand crisis, the major cultural industries were still drinking
deeply from the river of baby-boomer buying power, and the youth demographic found itself on the
periphery, upstaged by the awesome power of classic rock and reunion tours. Of course actual
young consumers remained a concern for the industries that narrowly market to teens, but youth
culture itself was regarded as a rather shallow and tepid well of inspiration by the entertainment and
advertising industries. Sure, there were plenty of young people who considered their culture

"alternative" or "underground" in the seventies and eighties. Every urban centre maintained its
bohemian pockets, where the faithful wrapped themselves in black, listened to the Grateful Dead or
punk (or the more digestible New Wave), and shopped at second-hand clothing stores and in dank
record stores. If they lived outside urban centres, tapes and accessories of the cool lifestyle could be
ordered from the backs of magazines like Maximum Rock 'n' Roll, or swapped through networks of
friends or purchased at concerts.
While this is a gross caricature of the youth subcultures that rose and fell during these decades, the
relevant distinction is that these scenes were only half-heartedly sought after as markets. In part this
was because seventies punk was at its peak at the same time as the infinitely more mass-marketable
disco and heavy metal, and the gold mine of high-end preppy style. And while rap music
was
topping the charts by the mid- to late eighties, arriving complete with a
fully articulated style
and code, white America was not about to declare the
arrival of a new youth culture.
That day would have to wait a few years until the styles and sounds of urban black youth were fully
co-opted by white suburbia.
So there was no mass-marketing machine behind these subcultures: there was no Internet, no
travelling alternative-culture shopping malls like Lollapalooza or Lilith Fair, and there certainly
weren't slick catalogs like Delia and Airshop, which now deliver body glitter, plastic pants and bigcity attitude like pizzas to kids stuck in the suburbs. The industries that drove Western
consumerism were still catering to the citizens of Woodstock Nation, now morphed into
consumption-crazed yuppies. Most of their kids, too, could be counted on as yuppies-in-training, so
keeping track of the trends and tastes favoured by style-setting youth wasn't worth the effort.
Where I’m from there wasn’t no scene I got my information reading Highlights magazine.
– Princess Superstar, “I’m White,” Strictly Platinum

]7^_7½©+sg$^y­¾j+!?_gWj#_ng$^_\o©j~
All that changed in the early nineties when the baby boomers dropped their end of the consumer
chain and the brands underwent their identity crisis. At about the time of Marlboro Friday, Wall
Street took a closer look at the brands that had flourished through the recession, and noticed
something interesting. Among the industries that were holding steady or taking off were beer, soft
drinks, fast food and sneakers — not to mention chewing gum and Barbie dolls. There was
something else: 1992 was the first year since 1975 that the number of teenagers in America
increased. Gradually, an idea began to dawn on many in the manufacturing sector and
entertainment industries: maybe their sales were slumping not because consumers were "brandblind," but because these companies had their eyes fixed on the wrong demographic prize. This was
not a time for selling Tide and Snuggle to housewives — it was a time for beaming MTV, Nike,
Hilfiger, Microsoft, Netscape and Wired to global teens and their overgrown imitators. Their
parents might have gone bargain basement, but kids, it turned out, were still willing to pay up to fit
in. Through this process, peer pressure emerged as a powerful market force, making the keepingup-with-the-Joneses consumerism of their suburban parents pale by comparison. As clothing
retailer Elise Decoteau said of her teen shoppers, "They run in packs. If you sell to one, you sell to
everyone in their class and everyone in their school."
There was just one catch. As the success of branding superstars like Nike had shown, it was not
going to be sufficient for companies simply to market their same products to a younger

demographic; they needed to fashion brand identities that would resonate with this new culture. If
they were going to turn their lacklustre products into transcendent meaning machines-as the dictates
of branding demanded — they would need to remake themselves in the image of nineties cool: its
music, styles and politics.

XX}¿dE+~<³E]\^_a`ij+dk<n|U`j#w4¶g$ª/w3^X}
Fuelled by the dual promises of branding and the youth market, the corporate sector experienced a
burst of creative energy. Cool, alternative, young, hip —whatever you want to call it-was the
perfect identity for product-driven companies looking to become transcendent image-based brands.
Advertisers, brand managers, music, film and television producers raced back to high school,
sucking up to the in-crowd in a frantic effort to isolate and reproduce in TV commercials the
precise "attitude" teens and twenty-something’s were driven to consume with their snack foods and
pop tunes. And as in high schools everywhere, "Am I cool?" became the deeply dull and allconsuming question of every moment, echoing not only through class and locker rooms, but
through the high-powered meetings and conference calls of Corporate High.
The quest for cool is by nature riddled with self-doubt ("Is this cool?" one can hear the legions of
teen shoppers nervously quizzing each other. "Do you think this is lame?") Except now the
harrowing doubts of adolescence are the billion-dollar questions of our age. The insecurities go
round and round the boardroom table, turning ad writers, art directors and CEOs into turbopowered teenagers, circling in front of their bedroom mirrors trying to look blasé. Do the kids think
we're cool? they want to know. Are we trying too hard to be cool, or are we really cool? Do we
have attitude? The right attitude?
The Wall Street Journal regularly runs serious articles about how the trend toward wide-legged
jeans or miniature backpacks is affecting the stock market. IBM, out-cooled in the eighties by
Apple, Microsoft and pretty well everybody, has become fixated on trying to impress the cool kids,
or, in the company's lingo, the "People in Black." "We used to call them the ponytail brigade, the
black turtleneck brigade," says IBM's David Gee, whose job it is to make Big Blue cool. "Now
they're the PIBs —People in Black. We have to be relevant to the PIBs." For Pepe Jeans, the goal,
articulated by marketing director Phil Spur, is this: "They [the cool kids] have to look at your jeans,
look at your brand image and say 'that's cool...' At the moment we're ensuring that Pepe is seen in
the right places and on the right people."
The companies that are left out of the crowd of successfully hip brands — their sneakers too small,
their pant-legs too tapered, their edgy ads insufficiently ironic —now skulk on the margins of
society: the corporate nerds. "Coolness is still elusive for us," says Bill Benford, president of L.A.
Gear athletic wear, and one half expects him to slash his wrists like some anxious fifteen-year-old
unable to face schoolyard exile for another term. No one is safe from this brutal ostracism, as Levi
Strauss learned in 1998. The verdict was merciless: Levi's didn't have superstores like Disney, it
didn't have cool ads like the Gap, it didn't have hip-hop credibility like Hilfiger and no one wanted
to tattoo its logo on their navel, like Nike. In short, it wasn't cool. It had failed to understand, as its
new brand developer Sean Dee diagnosed, that "loose jeans is not a fad, it's a paradigm shift."
Cool, it seems, is the make-or-break quality in 1990s branding. It is the ironic sneer-track of ABC
sitcoms and late-night talk shows; it is what sells psychedelic Internet servers, extreme sports gear,

ironic watches, mind-blowing fruit juices, kitsch-laden jeans, post-modern sneakers and postgender colognes. Our "aspirational age," as they say in marketing studies, is about seventeen. This
applies equally to the forty-seven-year-old baby boomers scared of losing their cool and the sevenyear-olds kick-boxing to the Backstreet Boys.
As the mission of corporate executives becomes to imbue their companies with deep coolness, one
can even foresee a time when the mandate of our elected leaders will be "Make the Country Cool."
In many ways, that time is already here. Since his election in 1997, England's young Prime
Minister, Tony Blair, has been committed to changing Britain's somewhat dowdy image to "Cool
Britannia." After attending a summit with Blair in an art-directed conference room in Canary
Wharf, French president Jacques Chirac said, "I'm impressed. It all gives Britain the image of a
young, dynamic and modern country." At the G-8 summit in Birmingham, Blair turned the august
gathering into a basement rec room get-together, where the leaders watched All Saints music videos
and then were led in a round of "All You Need Is Love"; no Nintendo games were reported. Blair is
a world leader as nation stylist — but will his attempt to "rebrand Britain" really work, or will he be
stuck with the old, outdated Brit brand? If anyone can do it, it's Blair, who took a page from the
marketers of Revolution Soda and successfully changed the name of his party from an actual
description of its loyalties and policy proclivities (that would be "labour") to the brand-asset
descriptor "New Labour." His is not the Labour Party but a labour-scented party.

The journey to our current state of world cool almost ended, however, before it really began. Even
though by 1993 there was scarcely a fashion, food, beverage or entertainment company that didn't
pine for what the youth market promised, many were at a loss as to how to get it. At the time that
cool-envy hit, many corporations were in the midst of a hiring freeze, recovering from rounds of
layoffs, most of which were executed according to the last-hired-first-fired policies of the lateeighties recession. With far fewer young workers on the payroll and no new ones coming up
through the ranks, many corporate executives found themselves in the odd position of barely
knowing anyone under thirty years old. In this stunted context, youth itself looked oddly exotic —
and information about Xers, Generation Y and twenty-something’s was suddenly a most precious
commodity.
Fortunately, a backlog of hungry twenty-something’s were already in the job market. Like good
capitalists, many of these young workers saw a market niche: being professionally young. In so
many words, they assured would-be bosses that if they were hired, hip, young countercultures
would be hand-delivered at the rate of one per week; companies would be so cool, they would get
respect in the scenes. They promised the youth demographic, the digital revolution, a beeline into
convergence.
And as we now know, when they got the job, these conduits of cool saw no need to transform
themselves into clone-ish Company Men. Many can be seen now, roaming the hallways of Fortune
500 corporations dressed like club kids, skateboard in tow. They drop references to all-night raves
at the office water cooler ("Memo to the boss: why not fill this thing with ginseng-laced herbal iced
tea?"). The CEOs of tomorrow aren't employees, they are, to use a term favoured at IBM, "change
agents." But are they impostors — scheming "suits" hiding underneath hip-hop snowboarding gear?
Not at all. Many of these young workers are the real deal; the true and committed product of the

scenes they serve up, and utterly devoted to the transformation of their brands. Like Tom Cruise in
Jerry Maguire, they stay up late into the night penning manifestos, revolutionary tracts about the
need to embrace the new, to flout bureaucracy, to get on the Web or be left behind, to redo the ad
campaign with a groovier, grittier feel, to change quicker, be hipper.
And what do the change agents' bosses have to say about all this? They say bring it on, of course.
Companies looking to fashion brand identities that will mesh seamlessly with the Zeitgeist
understand, as Marshall McLuhan wrote, "When a thing is current, it creates currency." The change
agents stroke their bosses' middle-aged egos simply by showing up — how out of touch could the
boss be with a radical like this on the same intranet system? Just look at Netscape, which no longer
employs a personnel manager and instead has Margie Mader, Director of Bringing in the Cool
People. When asked by Fast Company, "How do you interview for cool?" she replied, "...there are
the people who just exude cool: one guy skateboarded here for his interview; another held his
interview in a roller-hockey rink." At MTV, a couple of twenty-five-year-old production assistants,
both named Melissa, co-wrote a document known as the "Melissa Manifesto," calling on the
already insufferably bubbly channel to become even more so. ("We want a cleaner, brighter, more
fun MTV," was among their fearless demands.) Upon reading the tract, MTV President Judy
McGrath told one of her colleagues, "I feel like blowing everybody out and putting these people in
charge."" Fellow rebel Tom Freston, CEO of MTV, explains that "Judy is inherently an antiestablishment person. Anybody who comes along and says, 'Let's off the pig,' has got her ear."

While the change agents were getting set to cool the corporate world from the inside out, a new
industry of "cool hunters" was promising to cool the companies from the outside in. The major
corporate cool consultancies — Sputnik, The L. Report, Bureau de Style-were all founded between
1994 and 1996, just in time to present themselves as the brands' personal cool shoppers. The idea
was simple: they would search out pockets of cutting-edge lifestyle, capture them on videotape and
return to clients like Reebok, Absolut Vodka and Levi's with such bold pronouncements as "Monks
are cool." They would advise their clients to use irony in their ad campaigns, to get surreal, to use
"viral communications."
In their book Street Trends, Sputnik founders Janine Lopiano-Misdom and Joanne De Luca
concede that almost anyone can interview a bunch of young people and make generalizations, "but
how do you know they are the 'right' ones — have you been in their closets? Trailed their daily
routines? Hung out with them socially?... Are they the core consumers, or the mainstream
followers?" Unlike the market researchers who use focus groups and one-way glass to watch kids
as if they were overgrown lab rats, Sputnik is "one of them" —it is in with the in-crowd.
Of course all this has to be taken with a grain of salt. Cool hunters and their corporate clients are
locked in a slightly S/M, symbiotic dance: the clients are desperate to believe in a just-beyondtheir-reach well of untapped cool, and the hunters, in order to make their advice more valuable,
exaggerate the crisis of credibility the brands face. On the off chance of Brand X becoming the next
Nike, however, many corporations have been more than willing to pay up. And so, armed with their
change agents and their cool hunters, the superbrands became the perennial teenage followers,
trailing the scent of cool wherever it led.

In 1974, Norman Mailer described the paint sprayed by urban graffiti artists as artillery fired in a
war between the street and the establishment. "You hit your name and maybe something in the
whole scheme of the system gives a death rattle. For now your name is over their name...your
presence is on their Presence, your alias hangs over their scene." Twenty-five years later, a
complete inversion of this relationship has taken place. Gathering tips from the graffiti artists of
old, the superbrands have tagged everyone — including the graffiti writers themselves. No space
has been left unbranded.

As we have seen, in the eighties you had to be relatively rich to get noticed by marketers. In the
nineties, you have only to be cool. As designer Christian Lacroix remarked in Vogue, "It's terrible
to say, very often the most exciting outfits are from the poorest people."
Over the past decade, young black men in American inner cities have been the market most
aggressively mined by the brandmasters as a source of borrowed "meaning" and identity. This was
the key to the success of Nike and Tommy Hilfiger, both of which were catapulted to brand
superstardom in no small part by poor kids who incorporated Nike and Hilfiger into hip-hop style at
the very moment when rap was being thrust into the expanding youth-culture limelight by MTV
and Vibe (the first mass-market hip-hop magazine, founded in 1992). "The hip-hop nation," write
Lopiano-Misdom and De Luca in Street Trends, is "the first to embrace a designer or a major label,
they make that label 'big concept' fashion. Or, in their words, they 'blow it up.'"
Designers like Stussy, Hilfiger, Polo, DK1MY and Nike have refused to crack down on the pirating
of their logos for T-shirts and baseball hats in the inner cities and several of them have clearly
backed away from serious attempts to curb rampant shoplifting. By now the big brands know that
profits from logowear do not just flow from the purchase of the garment but also from people
seeing your logo on "the right people," as Pepe Jeans' Phil Spur judiciously puts it. The truth is that
the "got to be cool" rhetoric of the global brands is, more often than not, an indirect way of saying
"got to be black." Just as the history of cool in America is really (as many have argued) a history of
African-American culture —from jazz and blues to rock and roll to rap —for many of the
superbrands, cool hunting simply means black-culture hunting. Which is why the cool hunters' first
stop was the basketball courts of America's poorest neighbourhoods.
The latest chapter in mainstream America's gold rush to poverty began in 1986, when rappers RunDMC breathed new life into Adidas products with their hit single "My Adidas," a homage to their
favourite brand. Already, the wildly popular rap trio had hordes of fans copying their signature
style of gold medallions, black-and-white Adidas tracksuits and low-cut Adidas sneakers, worn
without laces. "We've been wearing them all our lives," Darryl McDaniels (a k a DMC) said of his
Adidas shoes at the time. That was fine for a time, but after a while it occurred to Russell Simmons,
the president of Run-DMC's label Def Jam Records, that the boys should be getting paid for the
promotion they were giving to Adidas. He approached the German shoe company about kicking in
some money for the act's 1987 Together Forever tour. Adidas executives were sceptical about being
associated with rap music, which at that time was alternately dismissed as a passing fad or vilified
as an incitement to riot. To help change their minds, Simmons took a couple of Adidas bigwigs to a
Run-DMC show. Christopher Vaughn describes the event in Black Enterprise: "At a crucial

moment, while the rap group was performing the song ["My Adidas"], one of the members yelled
out, 'Okay, everybody in the house, rock your Adidas!' -and three thousand pairs of sneakers shot in
the air. The Adidas executives couldn't reach for their check books fast enough." By the time of the
annual Atlanta sports-shoe Super Show that year, Adidas had unveiled its new line of Run-DMC
shoes: the Super Star and the Ultra Star —"designed to be worn without laces."
Since "My Adidas," nothing in inner-city branding has been left up to chance. Major record labels
like BMG now hire "street crews" of urban black youth to talk up hip-hop albums in their
communities and to go out on guerrilla-style postering and sticker missions. The L.A.-based Steven
Rifkind Company bills itself as a marketing firm "specializing in building word-of-mouth in urban
areas and inner cities." Rifkind is CEO of the rap label Loud Records, and companies like Nike pay
him hundreds of thousands of dollars to find out how to make their brands cool with trend-setting
black youth.
So focused is Nike on borrowing style, attitude and imagery from black urban youth that the
company has its own word for the practice: bro-ing. That's when Nike marketers and designers
bring their prototypes to inner-city neighbourhoods in Mew York, Philadelphia or Chicago and say,
"Hey, bro, check out the shoes," to gauge the reaction to new styles and to build up a buzz. In an
interview with journalist Josh Feit, Mike designer Aaron Cooper described his bro-ing conversion
in Harlem: "We go to the playground, and we dump the shoes out. It's unbelievable. The kids go
nuts. That's when you realize the importance of Nike. Having kids tell you Nike is the number one
thing in their life —number two is their girlfriend." Nike has even succeeded in branding the
basketball courts where it goes bro-ing through its philanthropic wing, P.L.A.Y (Participate in the
Lives of Youth). P.L.A.Y sponsors inner-city sports programs in exchange for high swoosh
visibility, including giant swooshes at the centre of resurfaced urban basketball courts. In tonier
parts of the city, that kind of thing would be called an ad and the space would come at a price, but
on this side of the tracks, Mike pays nothing, and files the cost under charity.

Tommy Hilfiger, even more than Nike or Adidas, has turned the harnessing of ghetto cool into a
mass-marketing science. Hilfiger forged a formula that has since been imitated by Polo, Nautica,
Munsingwear (thanks to Puff Daddy's fondness for the penguin logo) and several other clothing
companies looking for a short cut to making it at the suburban mall with inner-city attitude.
Like a depoliticized, hyper-patriotic Benetton, Hilfiger ads are a tangle of Cape Cod
multiculturalism: scrubbed black faces lounging with their windswept white brothers and sisters in
that great country club in the sky, and always against the backdrop of a billowing American flag.
"By respecting one another we can reach all cultures and communities," the company says. "We
promote...the concept of living the American dream." But the hard facts of Tommy's interracial
financial success have less to do with finding common ground between cultures than with the
power and mythology embedded in America's deep racial segregation.
Tommy Hilfiger started off squarely as white-preppy wear in the tradition of Ralph Lauren and
Lacoste. But the designer soon realized that his clothes also had a peculiar cachet in the inner cities,
where the hip-hop philosophy of "living large" saw poor and working-class kids acquiring status in
the ghetto by adopting the gear and accoutrements of prohibitively costly leisure activities, such as

skiing, golfing, and even boating. Perhaps to better position his brand within this urban fantasy,
Hilfiger began to associate his clothes more consciously with these sports, shooting ads at yacht
clubs, beaches and other nautical locales. At the same time, the clothes themselves were redesigned
to appeal more directly to the hip-hop aesthetic. Cultural theorist Paul Smith describes the shift as
"bolder colours, bigger and baggier styles, more hoods and cords, and more prominence for logos
and the Hilfiger name." He also plied rap artists like Snoop Dogg with free clothes and, walking the
tightrope between the yacht and the ghetto, launched a line of Tommy Hilfiger beepers.
Once Tommy was firmly established as a ghetto thing, the real selling could begin - not just to the
comparatively small market of poor inner-city youth but to the much larger market of middle-class
white and Asian kids who mimic black style in everything from lingo to sports to music. Company
sales reached $847 million in 1998-up from a paltry $53 million in 1991 when Hilfiger was still, as
Smith puts it, "Young Republican clothing." Like so much of cool hunting, Hilfiger's marketing
journey feeds off the alienation at the heart of America's race relations: selling white youth on their
fetishization of black style, and black youth on their fetishization of white wealth.

Offering Fortune magazine readers advice on how to market to teenage girls, reporter Nina Munk
writes that "you have to pretend that they're running things.... Pretend you still have to be
discovered. Pretend the girls are in charge." Being a huge corporation might sell on Wall Street, but
as the brands soon learned on their cool hunt, "indie" was the pitch on Cool Street. Many
corporations were unfazed by this shift, coming out with faux indie brands like Politix cigarettes
from Moonlight Tobacco (courtesy of Philip Morris), Dave's Cigarettes from Dave's Tobacco
Company (Philip Morris again), Old Navy's mock army surplus (the Gap) and OK Cola (Coke).
In an attempt to cash in on the indie marketing craze, even Coke itself, the most recognizable brand
name on earth, has tried to go underground. Fearing that it was too establishment for brandconscious teens, the company launched an ad campaign in Wisconsin that declared Coke the
"Unofficial State Drink." The campaign included radio spots that were allegedly broadcast from a
pirate radio station called EKOC: Coke backward. Not to be outdone, Gap-owned Old Navy
actually did launch its own pirate radio station to promote its brand — a micro-band transmitter that
could only be picked up in the immediate vicinity of one of its Chicago billboards. And in 1999,
when Levi's decided it was high time to recoup its lost cool, it also went indie, launching Red Line
jeans (no mention of Levi's anywhere) and K-1 Khakis (no mention of Levi's or Dockers).

But Levi's may have, once again, missed a "paradigm shift." It hasn't taken long for these attempts
to seriously pitch the most generic of mass-produced products as punk-rock lifestyle choices to
elicit sneers from those ever-elusive, trend-setting cool kids, many of whom had already moved
beyond indie by the time the brands caught on. Instead, they were now finding ways to express
their disdain for mass culture not by opting out of it but by abandoning themselves to it entirely —
but with a sly ironic twist. They were watching Me/rose Place, eating surf 'n' turf in revolving
restaurants, singing Frank Sinatra in karaoke bars and sipping girly drinks in tikki bars, acts that

were rendered hip and daring because, well, they were the ones doing them. Not only were they
making a subversive statement about a culture they could not physically escape, they were rejecting
the doctrinaire Puritanism of seventies feminism, the earnestness of the sixties quest for
authenticity and the "literal" readings of so many cultural critics. Welcome to ironic consumption.
The editors of the zine Hermenaut articulated the recipe:
Following the late ethnologist Michel de Certeau, we prefer to concentrate our attention on the
independent use of mass culture products, a use which, like the ruses of camouflaged fish and
insects, may not "overthrow the system," but which keeps us intact and autonomous within that
system, which may be the best for which we can hope.... Going to Disney World to drop acid and
goof on Mickey isn't revolutionary; going to Disney World in full knowledge of how ridiculous and
evil it all is and still having a great innocent time, in some almost unconscious, even psychotic way,
is something else altogether. This is what de Certeau describes as "the art of being in-between,"
and this is the only path of true freedom in today's culture. Let us, then, be in-between. Let us revel
in Baywatch, Joe Camel, Wired magazine, and even glossy books about the society of spectacle
[touché], but let's never succumb to the glamorous allure of these things.
In this complicated context, for brands to be truly cool, they need to layer this uncool-equals-cool
aesthetic of the ironic viewer onto their pitch: they need to self-mock, talk back to themselves while
they are talking, be used and new simultaneously. And after the brands and their cool hunters had
tagged all the available fringe culture, it seemed only natural to fill up that narrow little strip of
unmarketed brain space occupied by irony with preplanned knowing smirks, someone else's couch
commentary and even a running simulation of the viewer's thought patterns. "The New Trash
brands," remarks writer Nick Compton of kitsch lifestyle companies like Diesel, "offer inverted
commas big enough to live, love and laugh within."
Pop Up Videos, the VH1 show that adorns music videos with snarky thought bubbles, may be the
endgame of this kind of commercial irony. It grabs the punch line before anyone else can get to it,
making social commentary - even idle sneering - if not redundant then barely worth the expense of
energy.
Irony's cozy, protected, self-referential niche is a much better fit than attempts to earnestly pass off
fruit drinks as underground rock bands or sneakers as gangsta rappers. In fact, for brands in search
of cool new identities, irony and camp have become so all-purpose that they even work after the
fact. It turns out that the so-bad-it's-good marketing spin can be deployed to resuscitate hopelessly
uncool brands and failed cultural products. Six months after the movie Showgirls flopped in the
theatres, for instance, MGM got wind that the sexploitation flick was doing okay on video, and not
just as a quasi-respectable porno. It seemed that groups of trendy twenty-something’s were
throwing Showgirls irony parties, laughing sardonically at the implausibly poor screenplay and
shrieking with horror at the aerobic sexual encounters. Not content to pocket the video returns,
MGM decided to relaunch the movie in the theatres as the next Rocky Horror Picture Show. This
time around, the newspaper ads made no pretence that anyone had seriously admired the film.
Instead, they quoted from the abysmal reviews, and declared Showgirls an "instant camp classic"
and "a rich sleazy kitsch-fest." The studio even hired a troupe of drag queens for the New York
screenings to holler at the crowd with bullhorns during particularly egregious cinematic moments.

With the tentacles of branding reaching into every crevice of youth culture, leaching brand-image
content not only out of street styles like hip-hop but psychological attitudes like ironic detachment,
the cool hunt has had to go further afield to find unpilfered space and that left only one frontier: the
past.
What is retro, after all, but history re-consumed with a PepsiCo tie-in and breath-mint and phonecard brand extensions? As the re-release of lost in Space, the Star Wars trilogy, and the launch of
The Phantom Menace made clear, the mantra of retro entertainment seems to be "Once more with
synergy!" as Hollywood travels back in time to cash in on merchandising opportunities beyond the
imagination of yesterday's marketers.

After almost a decade of the branding frenzy, cool hunting has become an internal contradiction:
the hunters must rarefy youth "microcultures" by claiming that only full-time hunters have the
know-how to unearth them — or else why hire cool hunters at all? Sputnik warns its clients that if
the cool trend is "visible in your neighbourhood or crowding your nearest mall, the learning is over.
It's too late.... You need to get down with the streets, to be in the trenches every day." And yet this
is demonstrably false; so-called street fashions - many of them planted by brandmasters like Nike
and Hilfiger from day one — reach the ballooning industry of glossy youth-culture magazines and
video stations without a heartbeat's delay. And if there is one thing virtually every young person
now knows, it's that street style and youth culture are infinitely marketable commodities.
Besides, even if there was a lost indigenous tribe of cool a few years back, rest assured that it no
longer exists. It turns out that the prevailing legalized forms of youth stalking are only the tip of the
iceberg: the Sputnik vision for the future of hip marketing is for companies to hire armies of
Sputnik spawns —young "street promoters," "Net promoters" and "street distributors" who will
hype brands one-on-one on the street, in the clubs and on-line. "Use the magic of peer-to-peer
distribution — it worked in the freestyle sport cultures, mainly because the promoters were their
friends.... Street promoting will survive as the only true means of personally 'spreading the word.'"
So all arrows point to more jobs for the ballooning industry of "street snitches," certified
representatives of their demographic who will happily become walking infomercials for Nike,
Reebok and Levi's.
By fall 1998 it had already started to happen with the Korean car manufacturer Daewoo hiring two
thousand college students on two hundred campuses to talk up the cars to their friends. Similarly,
Anheuser-Busch keeps troops of U.S. college frat boys and "Bud Girls" on its payroll to promote
Budweiser beer at campus parties and bars.' The vision is both horrifying and hilarious: a world of
glorified diary trespassers and professional eavesdroppers, part of a spy-vs.-spy corporate-fuelled
youth culture stalking itself, whose members will videotape one another's haircuts and chat about
their corporate keepers' cool new products in their grassroots newsgroups.

There is an amusing irony in the fact that so many of our captains of industry pay cool hunters good
money to lead them on the path to brand-image nirvana. The true barometers of hip are not the

hunters, the post-modern admen, the change agents or even those trendy teenagers they're all madly
chasing. They are the CEOs themselves, who are, for the most part, so damn rich that they can
afford to stay on top of all the coolest culture trends. Guys like Diesel Jeans founder Renzo Rosso,
who, according to Business Week, "rides to work on a Ducati Monster motorcycle." Or Nike's Phil
Knight, who only took off his ever-present wraparound Oakley sunglasses after Oakley CEO Jim
Jannard refused to sell him the company. Or famed admen Dan Wieden and David Kennedy who
built a basketball court — complete with bleachers —in their corporate headquarters. Or Virgin's
Richard Branson, who launched a London bridal store in a wedding dress, rappelled off the roof of
his new Vancouver mega store while uncorking a bottle of champagne and then later crash-landed
in the Algerian desert in his hot-air balloon — all during the month of December 1996. These
CEOs are the new rock stars —and why shouldn't they be? Forever trailing the scent of cool, they
are full-time, professional teenagers, but unlike real teenagers, they have nothing to distract them
from the hot pursuit of the edge: no homework, puberty, college-entrance exams or curfews for
them.

As we will see later on, the sheer voracity of the corporate cool hunt did much to provoke the rise
of brand-based activism: through adbusting, computer hacking and spontaneous illegal street
parties, young people all over the world are aggressively reclaiming space from the corporate
world, "un-branding" it, guerrilla-style. But the effectiveness of the cool hunt also set the stage for
Anticorporate activism in another way: inadvertently, it exposed the impotence of almost all other
forms of political resistance except anti-corporate resistance, one cutting-edge marketing trend at a
time.
When the youth-culture feeding frenzy began in the early nineties, many of us who were young at
the time saw ourselves as victims of a predatory marketing machine that co-opted our identities, our
styles and our ideas and turned them into brand food. Nothing was immune: not punk, not hip-hop,
not fetish, not techno — not even, as I'll get to in Chapter 5, campus feminism or multiculturalism.
Few of us asked, at least not right away, why it was that these scenes and ideas were proving so
packageable, so unthreatening - and so profitable. Many of us had been certain we were doing
something subversive and rebellious but...what was it again?
In retrospect, a central problem was the mostly unquestioned assumption that just because a scene
or style is different (that is, new and not yet mainstream), it necessarily exists in opposition to the
mainstream, rather than simply sitting unthreateningly on its margins. Many of us assumed that
"alternative" — music that was hard to listen to, styles that were hard to look at —was also
anticommercial, even socialist. In Hype!, a documentary about how the discovery of "the Seattle
sound" transformed a do-it-yourself hardcore scene into an international youth-culture-content
factory, Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder makes a rather moving speech about the emptiness of the
"alternative" breakthrough of which his band was so emblematic:
If all of this influence that this part of the country has and this musical scene has — if it doesn't do
anything with it, that would be the tragedy. If it doesn't do anything with it like make some kind of
change or make some kind of difference, this group of people who feel this certain way, who think
these sorts of things that the underdogs we've all met and lived with think — if they finally get to
the forefront and nothing comes out of it, that would be the tragedy.

But that tragedy has already happened, and Vedder's inability to spit out what he was actually
trying to say had more than a little to do with it. When the world's cameras were turned on Seattle,
all we got were a few anti-establishment fuck-yous, a handful of overdoses and Kurt Cobain's
suicide. We also got the decade's most spectacular "sell-out" — Courtney Love's awe-inspiring sail
from junkie punk queen to high-fashion cover girl in a span of two years. It seemed Courtney had
been playing dress-up all along. What was revealing was how little it mattered. Did Love betray
some karmic debt she owed to smudged eyeliner? To not caring about anything and shooting up?
To being surly to the press? Don't you need to buy in to something earnestly before you can sell it
out cynically?
Seattle imploded precisely because no one wanted to answer questions like those, and yet in the
case of Cobain, and even Vedder, many in its scene possessed a genuine, if malleable, disdain for
the trappings of commercialism. What was "sold out" in Seattle, and in every other subculture that
has had the misfortune of being spotlighted by the cool hunters, was some pure idea about doing it
yourself, about independent labels versus the big corporations, about not buying in to the capitalist
machine. But few in that scene bothered to articulate these ideas out loud, and Seattle — long dead
and forgotten as anything but a rather derivative fad — now serves as a cautionary tale about why
so little opposition to the theft of cultural space took place in the early to mid-nineties. Trapped in
the headlights of irony and carrying too much pop-culture baggage, not one of its antiheroes could
commit to a single, solid political position.
A similar challenge is now being faced by all those ironic consumers out there — a cultural suit of
armour many of us are loath to critique because it lets us feel smug while watching limitless
amounts of bad TV. Unfortunately, it's tough to hold on to that subtle state of De Certeau's "inbetweenness" when the eight-hundred-pound culture industry gorilla wants to sit next to us on the
couch and tag along on our ironic trips to the mall. That art of being in-between, of being ironic, or
camp, which Susan Sontag so brilliantly illuminated in her 1964 essay "Notes on Camp," is based
on an essential cliquiness, a club of people who get the aesthetic puns. "To talk about camp is
therefore to betray it," she acknowledges at the beginning of the essay, selecting the format of
enumerated notes rather than a narrative so as to tread more lightly on her subject, one that could
easily have been trampled with too heavy an approach.
Since the publication of Sontag's piece, camp has been quantified, measured, weighed, focusgrouped and test-marketed. To say it has been betrayed, as Sontag had feared, is an understatement
of colossal dimensions. What's left is little more than a vaguely sarcastic way to eat Pizza Pops.
Camp cannot exist in an ironic commercial culture in which no one is fully participating and
everyone is an outsider inside their clothes, because, as Sontag writes, "In naive, or pure, Camp, the
essential element is seriousness, a seriousness that fails."
Much of the early camp culture that Sontag describes involved using an act of imagination to make
the marginal — even the despised — glamorous and fabulous. Drag queens, for instance, took their
forced exile and turned it into a ball, with all the trappings of the Hollywood balls to which they
would never be invited. The same can even be said of Andy Warhol. The man who took the world
on a camping trip was a refugee from bigoted small-town America; the Factory became his
sovereign state. Sontag proposed camp as a defence mechanism against the banality, ugliness and
overearnest-ness of mass culture. "Camp is the modern dandyism. Camp is the answer to the

problem: how to be a dandy in the age of mass culture." Only now, some thirty-five years later, we
are faced with the vastly more difficult question, How to be truly critical in an age of mass camp?
Or perhaps it is not that difficult. Yes, the cool hunters reduce vibrant cultural ideas to the status of
archaeological artefacts, and drain away whatever meaning they once held for the people who lived
with them — but this has always been the case. It's a cinch to co-opt a style; and it has been done
many times before, on a much grander scale than the minor takeover of drag and grunge. Bauhaus
modernism, for example, had its roots in the imaginings of a socialist Utopia free of garish
adornment, but it was almost immediately appropriated as the relatively inexpensive architecture of
choice for the glass-and-steel skyscrapers of corporate America.
On the other hand, though style-based movements are stripped of their original meanings time and
time again, the effect of this culture vulturing on more politically grounded movements is often so
ludicrous that the most sensible reaction is just to laugh it off. The spring 1998 Prada collection, for
instance, borrowed heavily from the struggle of the labour movement. As "supershopper" Karen
von Hahn reported from Milan, "The collection, a sort of Maoist/Soviet-worker chic full of witty
period references, was shown in a Prada-blue room in the Prada family palazzo to an exclusive
few." She adds, "After the show, the small yet ardent group of devotees tossed back champagne
cocktails and canapés while urbane jazz played in the background."
Mao and Lenin also make an appearance on a Spring 1999 handbag from Red or Dead. Yet despite
these clear co-optations of the class struggle, one hardly expects the labour movements of the world
to toss in the towel in a huff, give up on their demands for decent working conditions and labour
standards worldwide because Mao is suddenly the It Boy in Milan. Neither are union members
everywhere accepting wage rollbacks because Pizza Hut aired a commercial in which the boss
delivers pizzas to a picket line and all anti-management animosity is abandoned in favour of free
food.
The Tibetan people in the West seem similarly nonplussed by their continued popularity with the
Beastie Boys, Brad Pitt and designer Anna Sui, who was so moved by their struggle that she made
an entire line of banana-print bikini tops and surfer shorts inspired by the Chinese occupation
(Women's Wear Daily dubbed the Tibet line "techno beach blanket bingo"). More indifference has
met Apple computers' appropriation of Gandhi for their "Think Different" campaign, and Che
Guevara's reincarnation as the logo for Revolution Soda (slogan: "Join the Revolution"; see image
on page 62) and as the mascot of the upscale London cigar lounge, Che. Why? Because not one of
the movements being "co-opted" expressed itself primarily through style or attitude. And so style
co-optation — and indeed any outside-the-box brain-storming on Madison Avenue - does not have
the power to undo them either.
It may seem cold comfort, but now that we know advertising is an extreme sport and CEOs are the
new rock stars, it's worth remembering that extreme sports are not political movements and rock,
despite its historic claims to the contrary, is not revolution. In fact, to determine whether a
movement genuinely challenges the structures of economic and political power, one need only
measure how affected it is by the goings-on in the fashion and advertising industries. If, even after
being singled out as the latest fad, it continues as if nothing had happened, it's a good bet it is a real
movement. If it spawns an industry of speculation about whether movement X has lost its "edge,"

perhaps its adherents should be looking for a sharper utensil. And as we will soon see, that is
exactly what many young activists are in the process of doing.

CHAPTER FOUR
THE BRANDING OF LEARNING

ªkn	-d²/w3^X}n7j+d?kyÂ¨d/	_!nA	«g	e_3n
A democratic system of education... is one of the surest ways of creating and greatly extending
markets for goods of all kinds and especially those goods in which fashion may play a part.
-Ex-adman James Rorly, Our Master's Voice. 1934
Although the brands seem to be everywhere - at kids' concerts, next to them on the couch, on stage
with their heroes, in their on-line chat groups, and on their playing fields and basketball courts - for
a long time one major unbranded youth frontier remained: a place where young people gathered,
talked, sneaked smokes, made out, formed opinions and, most maddeningly of all, stood around
looking cool for hours on end. That place is called school. And clearly, the brands had to get into
the schools.
"You'll agree that the youth market is an untapped wellspring of new revenue. You'll also agree that
the youth market spends the majority of each day inside the schoolhouse. Now the problem is, how

do you reach that market?" asks a typically tantalizing brochure from the Fourth Annual Kid Power
Marketing Conference.
As we have just seen, marketers and cool hunters have spent the better part of the decade hustling
the brands back to high school and pouring them into the template of the teenage outlaw. Several of
the most successful brands had even cast their corporate headquarters as private schools, referring
to them as "campuses" and, at the Nike World Campus, nicknaming one edifice "the student union
building." Even the cool hunters are going highbrow; by the late nineties, the rage in the industry
was to recast oneself less as a trendy club-hopper than as a bookish grad student. In fact, some
insist they aren't cool hunters at all but rather "urban anthropologists."
And yet despite their up-to-the-minute outfits and intellectual pretensions, the brands and their
keepers still found themselves on the wrong side of the school gate, a truly intolerable state of
affairs and. one that would not last long. American marketing consultant Jack Allyers described the
insufferable slight like this: "The choice we have in this country [the U.S.] is for our educational
system to join the electronic age and communicate to students in ways they can understand and to
which they can relate. Or our schools can continue to use outmoded forms of communications and
become the daytime prisons for millions of young people, as they have become in our inner cities."'
This reasoning, which baldly equates corporate access to the schools with access to modern
technology, and by extension to the future itself, is at the core of how the brands have managed,
over the course of only one decade, to all but eliminate the barrier between ads and education. It
was technology that lent a new urgency to nineties chronic under funding: at the same time as
schools were facing ever-deeper budget cuts, the costs of delivering a modern education were rising
steeply, forcing many educators to look to alternative funding sources for help. Swept up by infotech hype, schools that couldn't afford up-to-date textbooks were suddenly expected to provide
students with audiovisual equipment, video cameras, classroom computers, desktop publishing
capacity, the latest educational software programs, Intern-et access —even, at some schools, videoconferencing.
As many education experts have pointed out, the pedagogical benefits technology brings to the
classroom are dubious at best, but the fact remains that employers are clamouring for tech-trained
graduates and chances are the private school down the street or across town is equipped with all the
latest gadgets and toys. In this context, corporate partnerships and sponsorship arrangements have
seemed to many public schools, particularly those in poorer areas, to be the only possible way out
of the high-tech bind. If the price of staying modern is opening the schools to ads, the thinking
goes, then parents and teachers will have to grin and bear it.
The fact that more schools are turning to the private sector to finance technology purchases does
not mean that governments are relinquishing any role in supplying public schools with computers.
Quite the opposite. A growing number of politicians are making a computer on every desk a key
plank in their election platforms, albeit in partnership with local businesses. But in the process
school boards are draining money out of programs like music and physical education to finance this
high-tech dream — and here too they are opening the door to corporate sponsorships and to direct
forms of brand promotion in cash-strapped cafeterias and sports programs.
As fast-food, athletic gear and computer companies step in to fill the gap, they carry with them an
educational agenda of their own. As with all branding projects, it is never enough to tag the schools

with a few logos. Having gained a foothold, the brand managers are now doing what they have
done in music, sports and journalism outside the schools: trying to overwhelm their host, to grab
the spotlight. They are fighting for their brands to become not the add-on but the subject of
education, not an elective but the core curriculum.
Of course the companies crashing the school gate have nothing against education. Students should
by all means learn, they say, but why don't they read about our company, write about our brand,
research their own brand preferences or come up with a drawing for our next ad campaign?
Teaching students and building brand awareness, these corporations seem to believe, can be two
aspects of the same project. Which is where Channel One, owned by K-lll Communications, and its
Canadian counterpart, the Youth Mews Network, come in, perhaps the best-known example of inschool branding.
At the beginning of the decade, these self-styled in-school broadcasters approached North
American school boards with a proposition. They asked them to open their classrooms to two
minutes of television advertising a day, sandwiched between twelve minutes of teenybopper current
affairs programming. Many schools consented, and the broadcasts soon aired. Turning off the
cheerful ad patter is not an option. Not only is the programming mandatory viewing for students,
but teachers are unable to adjust the volume of the broadcast, especially during commercials. In
exchange, the schools do not receive direct revenue from the stations but they can use the muchcoveted audiovisual equipment for other lessons and, in some cases, receive "free" computers.
Channel One, meanwhile, charges advertisers top dollar for accessing its pipeline to classrooms —
twice as much as regular TV stations because, with mandatory attendance and no channel-changing
or volume control, it can boast something no other broadcaster can: "No audience erosion." The
station now boasts a presence in 12,000 schools, reaching an estimated eight million students (see
image on page 86).
When those students aren't watching Channel One or surfing with ZapMe!, an in-school Internet
browser first offered free to American schools in 1998, they may turn their attention to their
textbooks —and those too may be sending out more messages to "Just Do It" or "CK Be." The
Cover Concepts company sells slick ads that wrap around books to 30,000 U.S. schools, where
teachers use them instead of plastic or tinfoil as protective jackets. And when lunchtime arrives,
more ads are literally on the menu at many schools. In 1997, Twentieth Century-Fox managed to
get cafeteria menu items named after characters from its film Anastasia in forty U.S. elementary
schools. Students could dine on "Rasputin Rib-B-Cue on Bartok Bun" and "Dimitri's Peanut Butter
Fudge." Disney and Kellogg's have engaged in similar lunch-menu promotions through School
Marketing, a company that describes itself as a "school-lunch ad agency."
Competing with the menu sponsors are the fast-food chains themselves, chains that go head-to-head
with cafeterias in 13 percent of U.S. schools. In an arrangement that was unheard of in the eighties,
companies like McDonald's and Burger King now set up kiosks in lunchrooms, which they
advertise around the school. Subway supplies 767 schools with sandwiches; Pizza Hut corners the
market in approximately 4,000 schools; and a staggering 20,000 schools participate in Taco Bell's
"frozen burrito product line." A Subway sandwich guide about how to access the in-school market
advises franchisees to pitch their brand-name food to school boards as a way to keep students from
sneaking out at lunch hour and getting into trouble. "Look for situations where the local school

board has a closed campus policy for lunch. If they do, a strong case can be made for branded
product to keep the students on campus." The argument works for administrators such as Bob
Honson, the director of nutritional services for the Portland, Oregon, school district. "Kids come to
us with brand preferences," he explains.
Not all students' brand preferences, however, are accommodated with equal enthusiasm. Since the
fast-food outposts don't accept vouchers from kids on the federal lunch program and their food is
usually twice as expensive as cafeteria fare, kids from poor families are stuck with mystery meat
while their wealthier classmates lunch on Pizza Hut pizza and Big Macs. And they can't even look
forward to days when the cafeteria serves pizza or cheeseburgers, since many schools have signed
agreements with the chains that prohibit them from serving "generic versions" of fast-food items:
no-name burgers, it seems, constitute "unfair competition."
Students may also find that brand wars are being waged over the pop machine outside the gym. In
Canada and the U.S., many school boards have given exclusive vending rights to the Pepsi-Cola
Company in exchange for generally undisclosed lump sums. What Pepsi negotiates in return varies
from district to district. In Toronto, it gets to fill the 560 public schools with its vending machines,
to block the sales of Coke and other competitors, and to distribute "Pepsi Achievement Awards"
and other goodies emblazoned with its logo. In communities like Cayuga, a rural Ontario tobaccofarming town, Pepsi buys the right to brand entire schools. "Pepsi - Official Soft Drink of Cayuga
Secondary School" reads the giant sign beside the road. At South Fork High School in Florida,
there is a blunt, hard-sell arrangement: the school has a clause in its Pepsi contract committing the
school to "make its best effort to maximize all sales opportunities for Pepsi-Cola products."
Similarly bizarre and haphazard corporate promotions arrangements are thrown together on college
and university campuses around the world. At almost every university in North America,
advertising billboards appear on campus bicycle racks, on benches, in hallways linking lecture
halls, in libraries and even in bathroom stalls. Credit-card companies and long-distance phone
carriers solicit students from the moment they receive their orientation-week information kit to the
instant after they receive their degree; at some schools, diplomas come with an envelope stuffed
with coupons, credit offers and advertising flyers. In the U.S. Barnes & Noble is rapidly replacing
campus-owned bookstores, and Chapters has similar plans in Canada. Taco Bells, KFCs, Starbucks
and Pizza Huts are already fixtures on university campuses, where they are often clumped together
in food courts inside on-campus malls.
Not surprisingly, in the U.S and Canada the fiercest scholastic marketing battles are fought over
high-school gym class and university athletics. The top high-school basketball teams have
sponsorship deals with Nike and Adidas, which deck out teenagers in swoosh- and stripe-festooned
shoes, warm-ups and gym bags. At the university level, Nike has sponsorship deals with more than
two hundred campus athletics departments in the U.S. and twelve in Canada. As anyone familiar
with college ball well knows, the standard arrangement gives the company the right to stamp the
swoosh on uniforms, sports gear, official university merchandise and apparel, on stadium seats and,
most important, on ad banners in full view of the cameras that televise high-profile games. Since
student players can't get paid in amateur athletics, it is the coaches who receive the corporate
money to dress their teams in the right logos, and the amounts at stake are huge. Nike pays

individual coaches as much as $1.5 million in sponsorship fees at top sports universities like Duke
and North Carolina, sums that make the coaches' salaries look like tokens of appreciation.
As educational institutions surrender to the manic march of branding, a new language is emerging.
Nike high schools and universities square off against their Adidas rivals: the teams may well have
their own "official drink," either Coke or Pepsi. In its daily broadcasts, Channel One makes
frequent references to the goings-on at "Channel One schools." William Hoynes, a sociologist at
Vassar College who conducted a study on the broadcaster, says the practice is "part of a broader
marketing approach to develop a 'brand name' consciousness of the network, including the
promotion of the 'Channel One school' identity."
As several critics have pointed out, Channel One isn't just hawking its advertisers' sneakers and
candy to school kids, it is also selling the idea that its own programming is an invaluable
educational aid, one that modernizes such arid, outmoded educational resources as books and
teachers. In the model advanced by these broadcasters, the process of learning is little more than the
transferring of "stuff to a student's brain. Whether that stuff happens to be about a new blockbuster
from Disney or the Pythagorean theorem, the net effect, according to this theory, is the same: more
stuff stuffed. So Fox's attempts to flog Anastasia in schools didn't stop with lunch-menu ads; it also
provided teachers with an "Anastasia study guide." Jeffrey Godsick, Fox senior vice president of
publicity and promotion, explained that Fox was providing a service to the schools, not the other
way around. "Public school teachers are desperate for materials that will excite the kids," he said.
It's impossible to know which teachers use these branded materials in class and which ones toss
them away, but a report published by the U.S. Consumers Union in 1995 "found that thousands of
corporations were targeting school children or their teachers with marketing activities ranging from
teaching videos, to guidebooks, and posters to contests, product giveaways, and coupons."
It will come as no surprise that it is the folks at the Nike World Campus who have devised the most
advanced hybrid of in-class advertisement, public relations exercise and faux teaching aid: the "Airto-Earth" lesson kit. During the 1997-98 academic year, elementary school students in more than
eight hundred classrooms across the U.S. sat down at their desks to find that today's lesson was
building a Nike sneaker, complete with a swoosh and an endorsement from an NBA star. Called a
"despicable use of classroom time" by the National Education Association and "the warping of
education" by the Consumers Union, the make-your-own-Nike exercise purports to raise awareness
about the company's environmentally sensitive production process. Nike's claim to greenness relies
heavily on the fact that the company recycles old sneakers to re-cover community centre basketball
courts, which, in a post-modern marketing spiral, it then brands with the Nike swoosh.

In a corporate climate obsessed with finding the secret recipe for cool, there are still more in-school
resources to tap. After all, if there is one thing the cool hunters have taught us, it's that groups of
kids aren't just lowly consumers: they are also card-carrying representatives of their age
demographic. In the eyes of the brand managers, every lunchroom and classroom is a focus group
waiting to be focused. So getting access to schools means more than just hawking product —it's a
bona fide, bargain-basement cool-hunting opportunity.

For this reason, the in-school computer network ZapMe! doesn't merely sell ad space to its
sponsors; it also monitors students' paths as they surf the Net and provides this valuable market
research, broken down by the students' sex, age and zip code, to its advertisers. Then, when
students log on to ZapMe!, they are treated to ads that have been specially "micro-targeted" for
them. This kind of detailed market research is exploding in North American schools: weekly focus
groups, taste tests, brand-preference questionnaires, opinion polls, panel discussions on the Internet,
all are currently being used inside classrooms. And in a feat of peer-on-peer cool hunting, some
market researchers have been experimenting with sending kids home from school with disposable
cameras to take pictures of their friends and family —returning with documented evidence, in one
assignment conducted for Nike, "of their favourite place to hang out." Exercises like these are
"educational" and "empowering" the market researchers argue, and some educators agree. In
explaining the merits of a cereal taste test, the principal of Our Lady of Assumption elementary
school in Lynnfield, Massachusetts, said: "It's a learning experience. They had to read, they had to
look, they had to compare.""
Channel One is pushing the market-research model even further, frequently enlisting "partner"
teachers to develop class lessons in which students are asked to create a new ad campaign for
Snapple or to redesign Pepsi's vending machines. In New York and Los Angeles high-school
students have created thirty-second animated spots for Starburst fruit candies, and students in
Colorado Springs designed Burger King ads to hang in their school buses.'2 Finished assignments
are passed on to the companies and the best entries win prizes and may even be adopted by the
companies — all subsidized by the taxpayer-funded school system. At Vancouver's Laurier Annex
school, students in Grades 3 and 4 designed two new product lines for the British Columbia
restaurant chain White Spot. For several months in 1997, the children worked on developing the
concept and packaging for "Zippy" pizza burgers, a product that is now on the kids' menu at White
Spot. The following year, they designed an entire concept for birthday parties to be held at the
chain. The students' corporate presentation included "sample commercials, menu items, party
games invented by the students and cake ideas," taking into account such issues as safety, possible
food allergies, low costs "and allowing for flexibility." According to nine-year-old Jeffrey Ye, "It
was a lot of work."
Perhaps the most infamous of these experiments occurred in 1998, when Coca-Cola ran a
competition asking several schools to come up with a strategy for distributing Coke coupons to
students. The school that devised the best promotional strategy would win $500. Greenbriar High
School in Evans, Georgia, took the contest extremely seriously, calling an official Coke Day in late
March during which all students came to school in Coca-Cola T-shirts, posed for a photograph in a
formation spelling Coke, attended lectures given by Coca-Cola executives and learned about all
things black and bubbly in their classes. It was a little piece of branding heaven until it came to the
principal's attention that in an act of hideous defiance, one Mike Cameron, a nineteen-year-old
senior, had come to school wearing a T-shirt with a Pepsi logo. He was promptly suspended for the
offence. "I know it sounds bad — 'Child suspended for wearing Pepsi shirt on Coke Day,'" said
principal Gloria Hamilton. "It really would have been acceptable...if it had just been in-house, but
we had the regional president here and people flew in from Atlanta to do us the honour of being
resource speakers. These students knew we had guests."
Though all public institutions are starved for new sources of income, most schools and universities
do try to set limits. When York University's Atkinson College sent out a call to donors in 1997

stating that "for a gift of $10,000... you or your corporation can become the official sponsor for the
development and design of one of our new multi-media, high-tech courses," the college insisted
that only the courses' names were for sale — not their content. Roger Trull, who brokers deals with
corporations at Ontario's McMaster University, explains where he draws the line: "They have to be
things that don't impact on academics," meaning only extracurricular sponsorship. Besides, many
point out that before lunchrooms and letter-man sweaters went brand-name, schools weren't exactly
corporate-free turf. Advertising historian Stuart Ewen writes that as early as the 1920s, teaching
kids to consume was seen as just another way of promoting patriotism and economic well-being.
Back then, toothbrush companies visited American schools to conduct "toothpaste drills" and cocoa
producers made cameos in science class to demonstrate "the various stages in the production of
cocoa."
And in more recent history, commercialism had already become a major part of campus life before
the brands even arrived. For instance, U.S. college sports is a big business in its own right with
sales of merchandise generating $2.75 billion in 1997, a higher figure than the merchandising sales
of the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League.
And well before the fast-food invasion, many cafeterias had already been contracted out to
companies like Marriott and Cara, which also specialize in providing airlines and hospitals with
institutional glop.
For these catering giants, however, faceless and generic was their calling card — the very antithesis
of branding. When the prima-Donna brands arrived on campus, they brought their preening and
posturing values with them, introducing to schools new concepts like corporate image control, logo
visibility, brand-extension opportunities and the fierce protection of trade secrets. And this collision
of the dictates of academia with the dictates of branding often proves uncomfortable. At the
University of British Columbia, for instance, students have been unable to find out what is in the
text of an agreement between their school and the Coca-Cola Company. Despite the fact that UBC
is a publicly funded institution, the soft-drink company demanded that the amount it paid for the
vending rights are kept secret for reasons of corporate competitiveness. (Coca-Cola also refused to
cooperate with requests for information for this book, claiming that all of its campus activities —
including the precise number' of campuses with which it has agreements — are confidential "for
competitive purposes.")
In May 1996, students and faculty at the University of Wisconsin at Madison did find out what was
in the text of a sponsorship deal their administration was about to sign with Reebok —and they
didn't like what they discovered. The deal contained a "non-disparagement" clause that prohibited
members of the university community from criticizing the athletic gear company. The clause stated:
"During and for a reasonable time after the term, the University will not issue any official statement
that disparages Reebok. Additionally, the University will promptly take all reasonable steps
necessary to address any remark by any University employee, agent or representative, including a
Coach, that disparages Reebok, Reebok's products or the advertising agency or others connected
with Reebok." Reebok agreed to nix the demand after students and faculty members launched an
educational campaign about the company's patchy record on labour rights in Southeast Asia. What
was exceptional about the Wisconsin clause is that the university community found out about it
before the deal was signed. This has not been the case at other universities where athletic
departments have quietly entered into multimillion-dollar deals that contained similar gag orders.

The University of Kentucky's deal with Nike, for instance, has a clause that states that the company
has the right to terminate the five-year $25 million contract if the "University disparages the Nike
brand... or takes any other action inconsistent with the endorsement of Nike products." Nike denies
that its motivation is to stifle campus critics.
Regardless of the intentions when the deals are inked, the fact is that campus expression is often
stifled when it conflicts with the interests of a corporate sponsor. For example, at Kent State
University —one of the U.S. campuses at which Coca-Cola has exclusive vending rights —
members of the Amnesty International chapter advocated a boycott of the soft drink because CocaCola did business with the since-ousted Nigerian dictatorship. In April 1998, the activists made a
routine application to their student council for funding to bring in a human-rights speaker from the
Free Nigeria Movement. "Is he going to speak negatively about Coca-Cola?" a council member
asked. "Because Coca-Cola does a lot of positive things on our campus like helping organizations
and sports." The representatives from Amnesty replied that the speaker would indeed have some
negative comments to make about the company's involvement in Nigeria and funding for the event
was denied.
On some university campuses, protests critical of a corporate sponsor have been effectively
blocked. In August 1996, Tennis Canada hosted the DuMaurier Tennis Open Tournament,
sponsored by Imperial Tobacco, at York University. Concerned that neither a university nor a
sporting event should be seen to be endorsing tobacco products, an anti-smoking group, the Grim
Reaper Society, asked York for permission to pass out pamphlets to students and tournament goers
near the university stadium. Susan Mann, the president of York University, refused the request,
saying the school did not "normally" allow "interest groups" on campus "unless for University
purposes." Activists handed out cards and leaflets to motorists at a traffic light just outside the
entrance to York and, on the last day of the tournament, they staged a clever culture-jam: the
leaflets they handed out were shaped like fans. Clearly amused, many of the tournament goers
brought their fans inside the tennis stadium, cooling themselves off with anti-tobacco slogans. After
a few hours, police officers hired by the tournament approached the peaceful, off-site protest and,
citing traffic problems, ticketed two of the activists and seized all the remaining fans.
These are extreme examples of how corporate sponsorship deals re-engineer some of the
fundamental values of public universities, including financial transparency and the right to open
debate and peaceful protest on campus. But the subtle effects are equally disturbing. Many
professors speak of the slow encroachment of the mall mentality, arguing that the more campuses
act and look like malls, the more students behave like consumers. They tell stories of students
filling out their course-evaluation forms with all the smug self-righteousness of a tourist responding
to a customer-satisfaction form at a large hotel chain. "Most of all I dislike the attitude of calm
consumer expertise that pervades the responses. I'm disturbed by the serene belief that my function
—and more important, Freud's, or Shakespeare's, or Blake's —is to divert, entertain, and interest,"
writes University of Virginia professor Mark Edmundson in Harper's magazine. A professor at
Toronto's York University, where there is a full-fledged mall on campus, tells me that his students
slip into class slurping grande lattes, chat in the back and slip out. They're cruising, shopping,
disengaged.

While brands slowly transform the experience of campus life for undergraduates, another kind of
takeover is under way at the institutional research level. All over the world, university campuses are
offering their research facilities, and priceless academic credibility, for the brands to use as they
please. And in North America today, corporate research partnerships at universities are used for
everything: designing new Nike skates, developing more efficient oil extraction techniques for
Shell, assessing the Asian market's stability for Disney, testing the consumer demand for higher
bandwidth for Bell or measuring the relative merits of a brand-name drug compared with a generic
one, to name just a few examples.
Dr. Betty Dong, a medical researcher at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), had
the misfortune of taking on that last assignment -testing a brand-name drug with brand-name
money. Dong was the director of a study sponsored by the British pharmaceutical company Boots
(now called Knoll) and UCSF. The fate of that partnership does much to illuminate precisely how
the mandate of universities as sites for public-interest research is often squarely at odds with the
interests of branded fact-finding missions.
Dr. Dong's study compared the effectiveness of Boots' thyroid drug, Synthroid, with a generic
competitor. The company hoped that the research would prove that its much higher priced drug was
better or at least substantially different from the generic one — a claim that, if legitimized by a
study from a respected university, would increase Synthroid sales. Instead, Dr. Dong found that the
opposite was true. The two drugs were bio-equivalent, a fact that represented a potential saving of
$365 million a year for the eight million Americans who were taking the name-brand drug, and a
potential loss to Boots of $600 million (the revenue from Synthroid). After the results were
reviewed by her peers, Dr. Dong's findings were slated to be published in the Journal of the
American Medical Association on January 25, 1995. At the last minute, however, Boots
successfully halted publication of the article, pointing to a clause in the partnership contract that
gave the company veto rights over the publication of findings. The university, fearing a costly
lawsuit, sided with the drug company and the article was yanked. After the whole ordeal was
exposed in The Wall Street Journal, Boots backed off and the paper was finally published in April
1997, two years behind schedule. "The victim is obvious: the university," wrote Dorothy S.
Zinberg, a faculty member at Harvard's Centre for Science and International Affairs. "Each
infringement on its unwritten contract with society to avoid secrecy whenever possible and
maintain its independence from government or corporate pressure weakens its integrity."
In 1998, a similar case ripped through the University of Toronto and the affiliated Hospital for Sick
Children — only this time, the researcher found that the drug being tested might actually be
harmful to patients. Dr. Nancy Olivieri, a world-renowned scientist and expert on the blood
disorder thalassemia, entered into a research contract with the drug-company giant Apotex. The
company wanted Olivieri to test the effectiveness of the drug deferi-prone on her young patients
suffering from thalassemia major. When Olivieri found evidence that, in some cases, the drug
might have life-threatening side effects, she wanted to warn the patients participating in the trial
and to alert other doctors in her field. Apotex pulled the plug on the study and threatened to sue
Olivieri if she went public, pointing to an overlooked clause in the research contract that gave it the
right to suppress findings for one year after the trials ended. Olivieri went ahead and published in
The New England Journal of Medicine and, once again, the administration of both her university
and her hospital failed to defend the sanctity of academic research conducted in the public interest.

Adding further insult, in January 1999, they demoted Olivieri from her top-level research position
at the hospital. (After a long and public battle, the doctor eventually got her job back.)
Perhaps the most chilling of these cases involves an associate professor at Brown University in
Rhode Island, who worked as an occupational health physician at the university-affiliated Memorial
Hospital of Rhode Island in Pawtucket. Dr. David Kern was commissioned by a local textile factory
to investigate two cases of lung disease that he had treated at the hospital. He found six more cases
of the disease in the ISO-person plant, a startling occurrence since its incidence in the general
population is one in 40,000. Like Dr. Dong and Dr. Olivieri, Dr. Kern was set to present a paper on
his findings when the textile company threatened to sue, citing a clause in the agreement that
prevented the publication of "trade secrets." Once again, the university and the hospital
administration sided squarely with the company, forbidding Dr. Kern to publish his findings and
shutting down the one-person clinic where he conducted his research.
The only element out of the ordinary in these three cases of stifled research is that they involved
academics with the personal integrity and the dogged tenacity to publicly challenge their corporate
"partners" and their own employers — factors that eventually led to the truth coming out through
the press. But relying on crusading individuals to protect the integrity of academic research does
not provide a foolproof safeguard in every case. According to a 1994 study conducted on industry
research partnerships at U.S. universities, most corporate interference occurs quietly and with no
protest. The study found that companies maintained the right to block the publication of findings in
35 percent of cases, while 53 percent of the academics surveyed agreed that "publication can be
delayed."
Kmart’s attitude always has been: What did we get from you this year? … Many people at Kmart thought I was
employed by Kmart.
- J. Patrick Kelly, Kmart Chair of Marketing at Wayne State University. The Chronicle of Higher Education, April
1998.

There is also a more insidious level of interference that takes place at universities every day,
interference that occurs before research even begins,
being committed to paper. As John V. Lombardi, president of the University of Florida at
Gamesville, says: We have taken the great leap forward and said: 'Let's pretend we're a
corporation.'" What such a leap means back on the ground is that studies are designed to fit the
mandate of corporate-endowed research chairs with such grand names as the Taco Bell
Distinguished Professor of Hotel and Restaurant Administration at Washington State University,
the Yahoo! Chair of Information-Systems Technology at Stanford University and the Lego
Professorship of Learning Research at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. J. Patrick Kelly, the
professor who holds the Kmart Chair of Marketing at Wayne State, estimates that his research has
saved Kmart "many more times" the amount of the $2 million donation that created his position.
The professor who holds the Kmart-endowed chair at West Virginia University, meanwhile, has
such a hands-on relationship with the retailer that he or she is required by contract to spend a
minimum of thirty days a year training assistant managers.

Many people, upon learning of the advanced stage of branded education, want to know where the
university faculty, teachers, school boards and parents were while this transformation was taking
place. At the elementary and high-school level, this is a difficult question to answer —particularly
since one is hard-pressed to find anyone but the advertisers who is actively in favour of allowing
ads into schools. Over the course of the decade, all the large teachers' unions in North America have
been quite vocal about the threat to independent instruction posed by commercialization, and many
concerned parents have formed groups like Ralph Nader's Commercial Alert to make their
opposition heard. Despite this, however, there was never one big issue on which parents and
educators could band together to fight — and possibly win — a major policy battle on classroom
commercialization.
Unlike the very public standoffs over prayer in schools or over explicit sex education, the move to
allow advertisements did not take the form of one sweeping decision but, rather, of thousands of
little ones. Usually these were made on an ad hoc, school-by-school basis, frequently with no
debate, no notice, no public scrutiny at all, because advertising agencies were careful to fashion
school promotions that could slip between the cracks of standard school-board regulations.
However, when Channel One and the Youth News Network wanted to bring ads directly into
classrooms, there was some debate: genuine, heated discussions took place at the school-board
level, and most boards across Canada decided to block YNN. Channel One, though far more
successful, particularly in poorer districts, has also had to swallow its share of board refusals.
There is, however, another, more ingrained cultural factor that has helped the brands get inside the
schools, and it has to do with the effectiveness of branding itself. Many parents and educators could
not see anything to be gained by resistance; kids today are so bombarded by brand names that it
seemed as if protecting educational spaces from commercialization was less important than the
immediate benefits of finding new funding sources. And the hawkers of in-school advertising have
not been at all shy about playing upon this sense of futility among parents and educators. As Frank
Vigil, president of ZapMe! computer systems, says: "America's youth is exposed to advertising in
many aspects of their lives. We believe students are savvy enough to discern between educational
content and marketing materials." Thus it became possible for many parents and teachers to
rationalize their failure to protect yet another previously public space by telling themselves that
what ads students don't see in class or on campus, they will certainly catch on the subway, on the
Net or on TV when they get home. What's one more ad in the life of these marked-up and markeddown kids? And then again...what's another?
But while this may explain the brands' inroads in high schools, it still doesn't explain how this
process has been able to take such a firm hold on the university campuses. Why have university
professors remained silent, passively allowing their corporate "partners" to trample the principles of
freedom of inquiry and discourse that have been the avowed centrepieces of academic life? More to
the point, aren't our campuses supposed to be overflowing with troublemaking tenured radicals?
Isn't the institution of tenure, with its lifelong promise of job security, designed to make it safe for
academics to take controversial positions without fear of repercussion? Aren't these people, to
borrow a term more readily understood in the halls of academe, counter-hegemonic?
As Janice Newson, a York University sociology professor who has published widely on this issue,
has noted: "On the surface, it is easier to account for the increasing realization of the corporate-

linked university than it is to account for the lack of resistance to it." Newson, who has been
sounding the alarm on the corporate threat to academic freedom for more than a decade, writes that
she had (wrongly) assumed that
members of the academic community would become actively concerned about, if not resistant to,
this shift in direction. After all, a significant if not transformative pattern of institutional change
has occurred over a relatively short period of time. And in many ways, these changes sharply
contrast to both the idea and the practices of the university that preceded them, the university in
which most current members of the academy began their careers. Newson's critique could well be
expanded to include student activists, who until the mid-nineties were also mysteriously absent
from the corporatization non-debate. Sadly, part of the explanation for the lack of campus
mobilization is simple self-interest. Until the mid-nineties, the growing corporate influence in
education and research seemed to be taking place almost exclusively in the engineering
departments, management schools and science labs. Campus radicals had always been prone to
dismiss these faculties as hopelessly compromised right-wing bastions: who cared what was
happening on that side of campus, so long as the more traditionally progressive fields (literature,
cultural studies, political science, history and fine arts) were left alone? And as long as professors
and students in the arts and humanities remained indifferent to this radical shift in campus culture
and priorities, they were free to pursue other interests — and there were many on offer. For
instance, more than a few of those tenured radicals who were supposed to be corrupting young
minds with socialist ideas were preoccupied with their own postmodernist realization that truth
itself is a construct. This realization made it intellectually untenable for many academics to even
participate in a political argument that would have "privileged" any one model of learning (public)
over another (corporate). And since truth is relative, who is to say that Plato's dialogues are any
more of an "authority" than Fox's Anastasia? This academic trend only accounts for a few of the
missing-in-actions, however. Many other campus radicals were still up for a good old political
fight, but during the key years of the corporate campus invasion they were tied up in a different
battle: the all-consuming gender and race debates of the so-called political correctness wars. As
we will see in the next chapter, if the students allowed themselves to be turned into test markets, it
was partly because they had other things on their minds. They were busy taking on their professors
on the merits of the canon and the need for more stringent campus sexual-harassment policies. And
if their professors failed to prevent the very principles of unfettered academic discourse from being
traded in for a quick buck, this may also have been because they were too preoccupied with
defending themselves against their own "McCarthyite" students. So there they all were, fighting
about women's studies and the latest backlash book while their campuses were being sold out from
under their feet. It wasn't until the politics of personal representation were themselves co-opted by
branding that students and professors alike began to turn away from their quarrels with each
other, realizing they had a more powerful foe.
But by then, much had already been lost. A/lore fundamentally than somewhat antiquated notions
of "pure" education and research, what is lost as schools "pretend they are corporations" (to borrow
a phrase from the University of Florida) is the very idea of unbranded space. In many ways, schools
and universities remain our culture's most tangible embodiment of public space and collective
responsibility. University campuses in particular —with their residences, libraries, green spaces and
common standards for open and respectful discourse - play a crucial, if now largely symbolic, role:
they are the one place left where young people can see a genuine public life being lived. And
however imperfectly we may have protected these institutions in the past, at this point in our history
the argument against transforming education into a brand-extension exercise is much the same as

the one for national parks and nature reserves: these quasi-sacred spaces remind us that unbranded
space is still possible.

Let's face it, when you're a story line on Friends, it's hard to keep thinking you're radical.
-Jay Blotcher, AIDS activist, New York magazine, September 1996

As an undergraduate in the late eighties and early nineties, I was one of those students who took a
while to wake up to the slow branding of university life. And I can say from personal experience
that it's not that we didn't notice the growing corporate presence on campus-we even complained
about it sometimes. It's just that we couldn't get particularly worked up about it. We knew the fastfood chains were setting up their stalls in the library and that profs in the applied sciences were
getting awfully cozy with pharmaceutical companies, but finding out exactly what was going on in
the boardrooms and labs would have required a lot of legwork, and, frankly, we were busy. We
were fighting about whether Jews would be allowed in the racial equality caucus at the campus
women's centre, and why the meeting to discuss it was scheduled at the same time as the lesbian
and gay caucus-were the organizers implying that there were no Jewish lesbians? No black
bisexuals? In the outside world, the politics of race, gender and sexuality remained tied to more

concrete, pressing issues, like pay equity, same-sex spousal rights and police violence, and these
serious movements were - and continue to be - a genuine threat to the economic and social order.
But somehow, they didn't seem terribly glamorous to students on many university campuses, for
whom identity politics had evolved by the late eighties into something quite different. Many of the
battles we fought were over issues of "representation" — a loosely defined set of grievances mostly
lodged against the media, the curriculum and the English language. From campus feminists arguing
over "representation" of women on the reading lists to gays wanting better "representation" on
television, to rap stars bragging about "representing" the ghettos, to the question that ends in a riot
in Spike Lee's 1989 film Do the Right Thing — "Why are there no brothers on the wall?" — ours
was a politics of mirrors and metaphors.
These issues have always been on the political agendas of both the civil-rights and the women's
movements, and later, of the fight against AIDS. It was accepted from the start that part of what
held back women and ethnic minorities was the absence of visible role models occupying powerful
social positions, and that media-perpetuated stereotypes — embedded in the very fabric of the
language — served to not so subtly reinforce the supremacy of white men. For real progress to take
place, imaginations on both sides had to be decolonized.
But by the time my generation inherited these ideas, often two or three times removed,
representation was no longer one tool among many, it was the key. In the absence of a clear legal or
political strategy, we traced back almost all of society's problems to the media and the curriculum,
either through their perpetuation of negative stereotypes or simply by omission. Asians and lesbians
were made to feel "invisible," gays were stereotyped as deviants, blacks as criminals and women as
weak and inferior: a self-fulfilling prophecy responsible for almost all real-world inequalities. And
so our battlefields were sitcoms with gay neighbours who never got laid, newspapers filled with
pictures of old white men, magazines that advanced what author Naomi Wolf termed "the beauty
myth," reading lists that we expected to look like Benetton ads, Benetton ads that trivialized our
reading-list demands. So outraged were we media children by the narrow and oppressive portrayals
in magazines, in books and on television that we convinced ourselves that if the typecast images
and loaded language changed, so too would the reality. We thought we would find salvation in the
reformation of MTV, CNN and Calvin Klein. And why not? Since media seemed to be the source
of so many of our problems, surely if we could only "subvert" them to better represent us, they
could save us instead. With better collective mirrors, self-esteem would rise and prejudices would
magically fall away, as society became suddenly inspired to live up to the beautiful and worthy
reflection we had retouched in its image.
For a generation that grew up mediated, transforming the world through pop culture was second
nature. The problem was that these fixations began to transform! us in the process. Over time,
campus identity politics became so consumed fry personal politics that they all but eclipsed the rest
of the world. The slogan '''the personal is political" came to replace the economic as political and, in
the end, the Political as political as well. The more importance we placed o»n representation issues,
the more central a role they seemed to elbow for themselves in our lives — perhaps because, in the
absence of more tangible political goals, any movement that is about fighting for better social
mirrors is going to eventually fall victim to its own narcissism.
Soon "outing" wasn't about AIDS, but became a blanket demand for gay and lesbian "visibility" —
all gays should be out, not just right-wing politicians but celebrities as well. By 1991, the radical

group Queer Nation had broadened its media critique: it didn't just object to portrayals of homicidal
madmen with AIDS, but any non-straight killer at all. The group's San Francisco and L.A. chapters
held protests against The Silence of the Lambs, objecting to its transvestite serial-killer villain, and
they disrupted filming on Basic Instinct because it featured ice-pick-wielding killer lesbians.
GLAAD (Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) had moved from lobbying the news
media about its use of terms like "gay plague" to describe AIDS, and had begun actively pushing
the networks for more gay and lesbian characters in TV shows. In 1993, Torie Osborn, a prominent
U.S. lesbian rights activist, said that the single biggest political issue facing her constituency was
not same-sex spousal benefits, the right to join the military or even the right of two women to marry
and adopt children. It was, she told a reporter, "Invisibility. Period. End of sentence."
Much like a previous generation of anti-porn feminists who held their rallies outside peep shows,
many of the political demonstrations of the early nineties had shifted from the steps of government
buildings and courthouses to the steps of museums with African art exhibits that were deemed to
celebrate the colonial mindset. They massed at the theatre entrances showing mega musicals like
Showboat and Miss Saigon, and they even crept right up to the edge of the red carpet at the 1992
Academy Awards.
These struggles may seem slight in retrospect, but you can hardly blame us media narcissists for
believing that we were engaged in a crucial battle on behalf of oppressed people everywhere: every
step we took sparked a new wave of apocalyptic panic from our conservative foes. If we were not
revolutionaries, why, then, were our opponents saying that a revolution was under way, that we
were in the midst of a "culture war"? "The transformation of American campuses is so sweeping
that it is no exaggeration to call it a revolution," Dinesh D'Souza, author of Illiberal Education,
informed his readers. "Its distinctive insignia can be witnessed on any major campus in America
today, and in all aspects of university life."
Despite their claims of living under Stalinist regimes where dissent was not tolerated, our
professors and administrators put up an impressively vociferous counteroffensive: they fought tooth
and nail for the right to offend us thin-skinned radicals; they lay down on the tracks in front of
every new harassment policy, and generally acted as if they were fighting for the very future of
Western civilization. An avalanche of look-alike magazine features bolstered the claim that ID
politics constituted an international emergency: "Illiberal Education" (Atlantic Monthly),
"Visigoths in Tweed" (Fortune), "The Silences" (Maclean's), "The Academy's New Ayatollahs"
(Outlook), "Taking Offence" (Newsweek). In New York magazine, writer John Taylor compared
my generation of campus activists with cult members, Hitler Youth and Christian fundamentalists.
So great was the threat we allegedly posed that George Bush even took time out to warn the world
that political correctness "replaces old prejudices with new ones."

The backlash that identity politics inspired did a pretty good job of masking for us the fact that
many of our demands for better representation were quickly accommodated by marketers, media
makers and pop-culture producers alike — though perhaps not for the reasons we had hoped. If I
had to name a precise moment for this shift in attitude, I would say August of 1992: the thick of the
"brand crisis" that peaked with Marlboro Friday. That's when we found out that our sworn enemies

in the "mainstream" — to us a giant monolithic blob outside of our known university-affiliated
enclaves —didn't fear and loathe us but actually thought we were sort of interesting. Once we'd
embarked on a search for new wells of cutting-edge imagery, our insistence on extreme sexual and
racial identities made for great brand-content and niche-marketing strategies. If diversity is what we
wanted, the brands seemed to be saying, then diversity was exactly what we would get. And with
that, the marketers and media makers swooped down, airbrushes in hand, to touch up the colours
and images in our culture.
The five years that followed were an orgy of red ribbons, Malcolm X baseball hats and Silence =
Death T-shirts. By 1993, the stories of academic Armageddon were replaced with new ones about
the sexy wave of "Do-Me Feminism" in Esquire and "Lesbian Chic" in New York and Newsweek.
The shift in attitude was not the result of a mass political conversion but of some hard economic
calculations. According to Rocking the Ages, a book produced in 1997 by leading U.S. consumer
researchers Yankelovich Partners, "Diversity" was the "defining idea" for Gen-Xers, as opposed to
"Individuality" for boomers and "Duty" for their parents.
Xers are starting out today with pluralistic attitudes that are the strongest we have ever measured.
As we look towards the next twenty five years, it is clear that acceptance of alternative lifestyles
will become even stronger and more widespread as Xers grow up and take over the reins of power,
and become the dominant buying group in the consumer marketplace.... Diversity is the key fact of
life for Xers, the core of the perspective they bring to the marketplace. Diversity in all of its forms
—cultural, political, sexual, racial, social — is a hallmark of this generation...
The Sputnik cool-hunting agency, meanwhile, explained that "youth today are one big sample of
diversity" and encouraged its clients to dive into the psychedelic "United Streets of Diversity" and
not be afraid to taste the local fare. Dee Dee Gordon, author of The L. Report, urged her clients to
get into Girl Power with a vengeance: "Teenage girls want to see someone who kicks butt back";
and, sounding suspiciously like me and my university friends, brand man Tom Peters took to
berating his corporate audiences for being "OWMs-Old White Males."
As we have seen, this information was coming hot on the heels of two other related revelations. The
first was that consumer companies would only survive if they built corporate empires around
"brand identities." The second was that the ballooning youth demographic held the key to market
success. So, of course, if the market researchers and cool hunters all reported that diversity was the
key character trait of this lucrative demographic, there was only one thing to be done: every
forward-thinking corporation would have to adopt variations on the theme of diversity as their
brand identities.
Which is exactly what most brand-driven corporations have attempted to do. In an effort to
understand how Starbucks became an overnight household name in 1996 without a single national
ad campaign, Advertising Age speculated that it had something to do with its tie-dyed, Third World
aura. "For devotees, Starbucks' 'experience' is about more than a daily espresso infusion; it is about
immersion in a politically correct, cultured refuge...." Starbucks, however, was only a minor player
in the P.C. marketing craze. Abercrombie £t Fitch ads featured guys in their underwear making
goo-goo eyes at each other; Diesel went further, showing two sailors kissing (see image on page
106); and a U.S. television spot for Virgin Cola depicted "the first-ever gay wedding featured in a
commercial," as the press release proudly announced. There were also gay-targeted brands like

Pride Beer and Wave Water, whose slogan is "We label bottles not people," and the gay community
got its very own cool hunters — market researchers who scoured gay bars with hidden cameras.
The Gap, meanwhile, filled its ads with racially mixed rainbows of skinny, childlike models. Diesel
harnessed frustration at that unattainable beauty ideal with ironic ads that showed women being
served up for dinner to a table of pigs. The Body Shop harnessed the backlash against both of them
by refusing to advertise and instead filled its windows with red ribbons and posters condemning
violence against women. The rush to diversity fitted in neatly with the embrace of AfricanAmerican style and heroes that companies like Nike and Tommy Hilfiger had already pinpointed as
a powerful marketing source. But Nike also realized that people who saw themselves as belonging
to oppressed groups were ready-made market niches: throw a few liberal platitudes their way and,
presto, you're not just a product but an ally in the struggle. So the walls of Nike Town were adorned
with quotes from Tiger Woods declaring that "there are still courses in the U.S. where I am not
allowed to play, because of the colour of my skin." Women in Nike ads told us that "I believe 'babe'
is a four-letter word" and "I believe high heels are a conspiracy against women."
And everyone, it seemed, was toying with the fluidity of gender, from the old-hat story of MAC
makeup using drag queen RuPaul as its spokesmodel to tequila ads that inform viewers that the she
in the bikini is really a he; from Calvin Klein's colognes that tell us that gender itself is a construct
to Sure Ultra Dry deodorant that in turn urges all the gender benders to chill out: "Man? Woman?
Does it matter?"

Å¸¬¬S!_3nn$	[Xdz°ZXnAg$jJ}«c	ej
Fierce debates still rage about these campaigns. Are they entirely cynical or do they indicate that
advertisers want to evolve and play more positive social roles? Benetton's mid-nineties ads careered
wildly between witty and beautiful challenges to racial stereotypes on the one hand, and grotesque
commercial exploitation of human suffering on the other. They were, however, indisputably part of
a genuine attempt to use the company's vast cultural real estate to send a message that went beyond
"Buy more sweaters"; and they played a central role in the fashion world's embrace of the struggle
against AIDS. Similarly, there is no denying that the Body Shop broke ground by proving to the
corporate sector that a multinational chain can be an outspoken and controversial political player,
even while making millions on bubble bath and body lotion. The complicated motivations and stark
inconsistencies inside many of these "ethical" businesses will be explored in greater depth in a later
chapter. But for many of the activists who had, at one point not so long ago, believed that better
media representation would make for a more just world, one thing had become abundantly clear:
identity politics weren't fighting the system, or even subverting it. When it came to the vast new
industry of corporate branding, they were feeding it.
The crowning of sexual and racial diversity as the new superstars of advertising and pop culture has
understandably created a sort of Identity Crisis. Some ex-ID warriors are even getting nostalgic
about the good old days, when they were oppressed, yes, but the symbols of their radicalism weren't
for sale at Wal-Mart. As music writer Ann Powers observed of the much-vaunted ascendancy of
Girl Power, "at this intersection between the conventional feminine and the evolving Girl, what's
springing up is not a revolution but a mall... Thus, a genuine movement devolves into a giant
shopping spree, where girls are encouraged to purchase whatever identity fits them best off the
rack." Similarly, Daniel Mendelsohn has written that gay identity has dwindled into "basically, a set

of product choices.... At least culturally speaking, oppression may have been the best thing that
could have happened to gay culture. Without it, we're nothing."
The nostalgia, of course, is absurd. Even the most cynical ID warrior will admit, when pressed, that
having Ellen Degeneres and other gay characters out on TV has some concrete advantages.
Probably it is good for the kids, particularly those who live outside of larger urban settings —in
rural or small-town environments, where being gay is more likely to confine them to a life of selfloathing. (The attempted suicide rate in 1998 among gay and bisexual male teens in America was
28.1 percent, compared with 4.2 percent among straight males of the same age group.) Similarly,
most feminists would concede that although the Spice Girls' crooning, "If you wanna be my lover,
you have to get with my friends" isn't likely to shatter the beauty myth, it's still a step up from
Snoop Dogg's 1993 ode to gang rape, "It ain't no fun if my homies can't have none."
And yet, while raising teenagers' self-esteem and making sure they have positive role models is
valuable, it's a fairly narrow achievement, and from an activist perspective, one can't help asking, Is
this it? Did all our protests and supposedly subversive theory only serve to provide great content for
the culture industries, fresh new lifestyle imagery for Levi's new "What's True" ad campaign and
girl-power-charged record sales for the music business? Why, in other words, were our ideas about
political rebellion so deeply non-threatening to the smooth flow of business as usual?
The question, of course, is not Why, but Why on earth not? Just as they had embraced the "brands,
not products" equation, the smart businesses quickly realized that short-term discomfort —whether
it came from a requirement to hire more women or to more carefully vet the language in an ad
campaign—was a small price to pay for the tremendous market share that diversity promised. So
while it may be true that real gains have emerged from this process, it is also true that Dennis
Rodman wears dresses and Disney World celebrates Gay Day less because of political progress
than financial expediency. The market has seized upon multiculturalism and gender-bending in the
same ways that it has seized upon youth culture in general — not just as a market niche but as a
source of new carnival-esque imagery. As Robert Goldman and Stephen Papson note, "White-bread
culture will simply no longer do." The $200 billion culture industry —now America's biggest
export —needs an ever-changing, uninterrupted supply of street styles, edgy music videos and
rainbows of colours. And the radical critics of the media clamouring to be "represented" in the early
nineties virtually handed over their colourful identities to the brandmasters to be shrink-wrapped.
The need for greater diversity — the rallying cry of my university years —is now not only accepted
by the culture industries, it is the mantra of global capital. And identity politics, as they were
practiced in the nineties, weren't a threat, they were a gold mine. "This revolution," writes cultural
critic Richard Goldstein in The Village Voice, "turned out to be the saviour of late capitalism." And
just in time, too.

About the same time that my friends and I were battling for better cultural representation, the
advertising agencies, broadcasters and global brands were preoccupied with some significant
problems of their own. Thanks to freer trade and other forms of accelerated deregulation, the global
marketplace was finally becoming a reality, but new, urgent questions were being asked: What is
the best way to sell identical products across multiple borders? What voice should advertisers use to

address the whole world at once? How can one company accommodate cultural differences while
still remaining internally coherent?
For certain corporations, until recently, the answer was simple: force the world to speak your
language and absorb your culture. In 1983, when global reach was still a fantasy for all but a
handful of corporations, Harvard business professor Theodore Levitt published the essay "The
Globalization of Markets," in which he argued that any corporation that was willing to bow to some
local habit or taste was an unmitigated failure. "The world's needs and desires have been
irrevocably homogenized," he wrote in what instantly became the manifesto of global marketing.
Levitt made a stark distinction between weak multinational corporations, which change depending
on which country they are operating in, and swaggering global corporations, which are, by their
very definition, always the same, wherever they roam. "The multinational corporation operates in a
number of countries, and adjusts its products and practices to each — at high relative costs. The
global corporation operates with resolute constancy — at low relative cost — as if the entire world
(or major regions of it) were a single entity; it sells the same things in the same way everywhere....
Ancient differences in national tastes or modes of doing business disappear."
Levitt's "global" corporations were, of course, American corporations and the "homogenized"
image they promoted were the images of America: blond, blue-eyed kids eating Kellogg's cereal on
Japanese TV; the Marlboro Man bringing U.S. cattle country to African villages; and Coke and
McDonald's selling the entire world on the taste of the U.S.A. As globalization ceased to be a
somewhat kooky dream and became a reality, these cowboy-marketing antics began to step on a
few toes. The twentieth century's familiar bogeyman — "American cultural imperialism" — has, in
more recent years, incited cries of "cultural Chernobyl" in France, prompted the creation of a "slowfood movement" in Italy and led to the burning of chickens outside the first KFC outlet in India.
Americans in particular have never been known for their cultural sensitivity and so, not
surprisingly, the road to Levitt's global marketing is paved with cultural faux pas. The most serious
of these took place after the collapse of European communism, when media moguls fell over one
another to take the credit for freedom and democracy the world over —a claim they would pay for
later on. "We put MTV into East Germany, and the next day the Berlin Wall fell," Viacom
International chairman Sumner Redstone said. Ted Turner claimed the credit for CNN and the
Goodwill Games. "I said, 'Let's try and undo this. Let's get our young people together, and let's get
this cycle together and let's try to get some world peace going and let's end the Cold War.' And, by
God, we did it." Rupert Murdoch, meanwhile, told the world that "satellite broadcasting makes it
possible for information-hungry residents of many closed societies to bypass state-controlled
television."
This post-Cold War bravado didn't go over too well in countries like China, where standing up to
so-called Western values remains a sacrosanct political claim. Consequently, several Western
media moguls —now hell-bent on penetrating all of Asia with their satellites-have gone to great
lengths to distance themselves from their earlier freedom-fighter rhetoric and now actively
collaborate with dictatorships to restrict the flow of information, a situation that I'll get to in more
detail in Chapter 8.
It was in this minefield that "diversity" marketing appeared, presenting itself as a cure-all for the
pitfalls of global expansion. Rather than creating different advertising campaigns for different

markets, campaigns could sell diversity itself, to all markets at once. The formula maintained the
one-size-fits-all cost benefits of old-style cowboy cultural imperialism, but ran far fewer risks of
offending local sensibilities. Instead of urging the world to taste America, it calls out, like the
Skittles slogan, to "Taste the Rainbow." This candy-coated multiculturalism has stepped in as a
kinder, gentler packaging for the homogenizing effect of what Indian physicist Vandana Shiva calls
"the monoculture" - it is, in effect, mono-multiculturalism.
Today the buzzword in global marketing isn't selling America to the world, but bringing a kind of
market masala to everyone in the world. In the late nineties, the pitch is less Marlboro Man, more
Ricky Martin: a bilingual mix of North and South, some Latin, some R&B, all couched in global
party lyrics. This ethnic-food-court approach creates a One World placelessness, a global mall in
which corporations are able to sell a single product in numerous countries without triggering the old
cries of "Coca-Colonization."
As culture becomes increasingly homogenized globally, the task of marketing is to stave off the
nightmare moment when branded products cease to look like lifestyles or grand ideas and suddenly
appear as the ubiquitous goods they really are. In its liquid ethnicity, marketing masala has been
introduced as the antidote to this horror of cultural homogeneity. By embodying corporate identities
that are radically individualistic and perpetually new, the brands attempt to inoculate themselves
against accusations that they are in fact selling sameness.

Of course not everyone is equally amenable to the idea of treating culture and nationality as fashion
accessories to be slipped on and off. Those who have fought wars and survived revolutions tend to
be more protective of their national traditions. The desolately poor, who constitute one-quarter of
the world's population,16 also have a little trouble getting into the global groove, especially since
cable TV and most brand-name products are still just a rumour in those parts of the developing
world where a total of 1.3 billion people live on US$1 a day or less. No, it's the young people living
in developed and semi-developed countries who are the great global hope. More than anything or
anyone else, logo-decorated middle-class teenagers, intent on pouring themselves into a mediafabricated mould, have become globalization's most powerful symbols.
This has happened for several reasons. First of all, just as in the U.S. market, there are a lot of them.
The world is crawling with teenagers, especially in southern countries, where the UN estimates that
507 million adults will die before they turn forty. Two-thirds of Asia's population is under thirty
and, thanks to years of bloody warfare, about 50 percent of the population in Vietnam was born
after 1975. All in all, the so-called global teen demographic is estimated at one billion, and these
teenagers consume a disproportionate share of their families' incomes. In China, for instance,
conspicuous consumption for all members of the household remains largely unrealistic. But, argue
the market researchers, the Chinese make enormous sacrifices for the young — particularly for
young boys — a cultural value that spells great news for cell-phone and sneaker companies. Laurie
Klein of Just Kid Inc., a U.S. firm that conducted a consumer study on Chinese teens, found that
while Mom, Dad and both grandparents may do without electricity, their only son (thanks to the
country's one-child policy) frequently enjoys what is widely known as "little emperor syndrome,"
or what she calls the "4-2-1" phenomenon: four elders and two parents scrimp and save so the one
child can be an 1VITV clone. "When you have the parents and four grandparents spending on one

child, it's a no-brainer to know that this is the right market," says one venture capitalist in China.
Furthermore, since kids are more culturally absorbent than their parents, they often become their
families' dedicated shoppers, even for big household items. Taken together, what this research
shows is that while adults may still harbour traditional customs and ways, global teens shed those
pesky national hang-ups like last year's fashions. "They prefer Coke to tea, Nikes to sandals,
Chicken McNuggets to rice, credit cards to cash," Joseph Quinlan, senior economist at Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. told The Wall Street Journal. The message is clear: get the kids and you've got the
whole family and the future market.
Diversity. Whatever. – Slogan for a1998-99 ad campaign for Eaton’s department store, Cananda

Inflated by rhetoric like this, the image of the global teen floats over the planet like a euphoric
corporate hallucination. These kids, we are repeatedly told, live not in a geographic place but in a
global consumer loop: hot-linked from their cellular telephones to Internet newsgroups; bonded
together by Sony Playstations, MTV videos and NBA games. The most extensive and widely cited
study of the global teen demographic was conducted in 1996 by the New York-based ad agency
DMB&B's BrainWaves division. The "New World Teen Study" surveyed 27,600 middle-class
fifteen- to eighteen-year-olds in forty-five countries and came up with some resoundingly good
news for the agency's clients, a list that includes Coca-Cola, Burger King and Philips. "Despite
different cultures, middle-class youth all over the world seem to live their lives as if in a parallel
universe. They get up in the morning, put on their Levi's and Nikes, grab their caps, backpacks, and
Sony personal CD players, and head for school." Elissa Moses, senior vice president at the
advertising agency, called the arrival of the global teen demographic "one of the greatest marketing
opportunities of all time."
But before the brands are able to sell the same products in the same way all around the world, the
teens themselves must identify with their new demographic. For this reason, what most global ad
campaigns are still selling most aggressively is the idea of the global teen market — a kaleidoscope
of multi-ethnic faces blending into one another: Rasta braids, pink hair, henna hand painting,
piercing and tattoos, a few national flags, flashes of foreign street signs, Cantonese and Arabic
lettering and a sprinkling of English words, all over the layered samplings of electronic music.
Nationality, language, ethnicity, religion and politics are all reduced to their most colourful, exotic
accessories, converging to assure us, as Diesel president Renzo Rosso does, there is "never an 'us
and them,' but simply one giant 'we.'"
To achieve this state of oneness, global teens must sometimes be pitted against traditional elders
who don't appreciate their radical taste in denim. For instance, a TV ad for Diesel jeans shows two
Korean teenagers turning into birds after they commit double suicide, finding freedom only in the
total surrender to the brand. In these ads, the ultimate product — more than the soft drinks, ice
creams, sneakers or jeans —is the global teen, who must exist as a demographic in the minds of
young consumers worldwide or the entire exercise of global marketing collapses. For this reason,
global youth marketing is a mind-numbingly repetitive affair, drunk on the idea of what it is
attempting to engineer: a third notion of nationality —not American, not local, but one that would
unite the two, through shopping.
Standing triumphant at the centre of the global teen phenomenon is MTV, which, in 1998, was in
273.5 million households worldwide — only 70 million of which were in the U.S. By 1999, MTV's

eight global divisions broadcast in 83 countries and territories, fewer than CNN's 212-country
reach, but impressive nonetheless. Furthermore, the New World Teen Study found that the single
most significant factor contributing to the shared tastes of the middle-class teens it surveyed was
TV —in particular, MTV, which 85 percent of them watched every day. Elissa Moses called the
station "an all-news bulletin for creating brand-images” and a "public-address system to a
generation." This sort of programming reach has been unprecedented since the 1950s when
families gathered around the TV set to watch the Ed Sullivan show. Global teens watch so much
MTV per day that the only equivalent shared cultural experience among adults occurs during an
outbreak of war when all eyes are focused on the same CNN images.
And the more viewers there are to absorb MTV's vision of a tribe of culture swapping, global teen
nomads, the more homogeneous a market its advertisers have in which to sell their products.
According to Chip Walker, director of the New World Teen Study, "Teens who watch MTV music
videos are much more likely than other teens to wear the teen 'uniform' of jeans, running shoes, and
denim jacket... They are also much more likely to own electronics and consume 'teen' items such as
candy, sodas, cookies and fast food. They are much more likely to use a wide range of personalcare products too." In other words MTV International has become the most compelling global
catalogue for the modern branded life.

The global economy's embrace of Representation Nation suggests that my generation's campus
identity politics boiled down, in the end, to a set of modest political goals that were frequently (and
deceptively) cloaked in immodest rhetoric and tactics. This isn't a P.C. mea culpa — I’m proud of
the small victories we won for better lighting on campus, more women faculty members and a less
Eurocentric curriculum (to dig up a much-maligned phrase from my P.C. days). What I question is
the battles we North American culture warriors never quite got around to. Poverty wasn't an issue
that came up much back then; sure, every once in a while in our crusades against the trio of 'isms,
somebody would bring up "classism," and, being out-P.C.-ed, we would dutifully add "classism" to
the hit list in question. But our criticism was focused on the representation of women and minorities
within the structures of power, not on the economics behind those power structures.
"Discrimination against poverty" (our understanding of injustice was generally construed as
discrimination against something) couldn't be solved by changing perceptions or language or even,
strictly speaking, individual behaviour. The basic demands of identity politics assumed an
atmosphere of plenty. In the seventies and eighties, that plenty had existed and women and nonwhites were able to battle over how the collective pie would be divided: would white men learn to
share, or would they keep hogging it? In the representational politics of the New Economy nineties,
however, women as well as men, and whites as well as people of colour, were now fighting their
battles over a single, shrinking piece of pie - and consistently failing to ask what was happening to
the rest of it. For us, as students, to address the problems at the roots of "classism" we would have
had to face up to core issues of wealth distribution - and, unlike sexism, racism or homophobia, that
was not what we used to call "an awareness problem."
So class fell off the agenda, along with all serious economic-let alone corporate — analysis.
Certainly there were those in the ID ranks with revolutionary goals. Like the sixties counterculture
radicals who thought they were shaking the foundations of Western civilization by dropping acid,
there were a handful of professors and students of identity politics who believed that "great blows

are being struck against capitalism in the realms of theory," as critic Gayatri Spivak put it. And
Dinesh D'Souza and his ilk couldn't resist calling the P.C.ers "nee-Marxists"-but in fact, nothing
could have been further from the truth. The prospect of having to change a few pronouns and
getting a handful of women and minorities on the board and on television posed no real threat to the
guiding profit-making principles of Wall Street. "The real guilt of P.C....," wrote SUMY professor
of literature Tim Brennan in 1991, "is not its supposed intolerance or rigidity, but that it is not
political enough — that it is impersonating political struggle."
That failure has turned out to be immeasurably problematic because the economic trends that have
so accelerated in the past decade have all been about massive redistribution and stratification of
world resources: of jobs, goods and money. Everyone except those in the very highest tier of the
corporate elite is getting less.
And what is striking in retrospect is that in the very years when P.C. politics reached their most
self-referential peak, the rest of the world was doing something very different: it was looking
outward, and expanding. At the moment when the field of vision among most left-wing
progressives was shrinking to include only its immediate surroundings, the horizons of global
business were growing to encompass the whole globe. While CEOs dreamed of Big Macs in
Russia, Benetton in Shanghai and logos projected on the moon, the political lens for far too many
activists and theorists was narrowing so dramatically that with the exception of a brief period
during the Gulf War, foreign and economic policy were off the radar screen. In North America,
even the fight against free trade was all about protecting Canadian or American workers and
resources, not about the possible effects of the trade agreement on Mexico, or the effects other rapid
liberalization measures were having in the developing world. When the free-trade debate was lost,
the left retreated even further into itself, choosing ever more minute disputes over which to go to
the wall. This retreat reflected a broader political paralysis in the face of the daunting abstractions
of global capitalism - ironically, the very issues that should have been most pressing for anyone
concerned with the future of social justice.
In this new globalized context, the victories of identity politics have amounted to a rearranging of
the furniture while the house burned down. Yes, there are more multi-ethnic sitcoms and even more
black executives -but whatever cultural enlightenment has followed has not prevented the
population in the underclass from exploding or homelessness from reaching crisis levels in many
North American urban centres. Sure, women and gays have better role models in the media and pop
culture —but the ownership in the culture industries has consolidated so rapidly that, according to
William Kennard, the chairman of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, "There are
fewer opportunities of entry by minority groups, community groups, small businesses in general."
And though girls may indeed rule in North America, they are still sweating in Asia and Latin
America, making T-shirts with the "Girls Rule" slogan on them and Nike running shoes that will
finally let girls into the game.
This oversight isn't simply a failure of feminism but a betrayal of the feminist movement's own
founding principles. Although the gender politics that I grew up with in the eighties were concerned
almost exclusively with having women equally represented in the structures of power, the
relationship between gender and class have not always been so casually overlooked. Bread and
Roses — the rallying cry of the women's movement — has its origin in a slogan on a banner in the
1912 walkout of textile workers in Lawrence, Massachusetts. "What the woman who labours

wants," explained historic organizer Rose Schneiderman in a 1912 speech, "is the right to live, not
simply exist." And March 8, the date of International Women's Day, was selected to mark the
anniversary of a 1908 demonstration in which "women garment workers marched through the
streets of New York, protesting dreadful working conditions, child labour, 12-hour working days,
minuscule pay." The young women who grew up reading The Beauty Myth, and who saw eating
disorders and low self-esteem as the most harmful by-products of the fashion industry, tended to
forget those women when we marched on March 8, if we ever knew about them to begin with.
As we look back, it seems like wilful blindness. The abandonment of the radical economic
foundations of the women's and civil-rights movements by the conflation of causes that came to be
called political correctness successfully trained a generation of activists in the politics of image, not
action. And if the space invaders marched into our schools and our communities unchallenged, it
was at least partly because the political models in vogue at the time of the invasion left many of us
ill-equipped to deal with issues that were more about ownership than representation. We were too
busy analyzing the pictures being projected on the wall to notice that the wall itself had been sold.
If that remained true until recently, however, it is no longer so. As we will see in Part IV, a radical
new political culture is emerging in high schools and on college campuses. Rather than calling
attention to the house of mirrors that passes for empirical truth (as the post-modern academics did),
and rather than fighting for better mirrors (as the ID warriors did), today's media activists are
concentrating on shattering the impenetrable shiny surfaces of branded culture, picking up the
pieces and using them as sharp weapons in a war of actions, not images.

BRAND BOMBING

MTV is associated with the forces of freedom and democracy around the world.

There isn't a lot of angst, it's just unbridled consumerism.
-MTV CEO Tom Freston describes the content on MTV India, June 1997

The branded multinationals may talk diversity, but the visible result of their actions is an army of
teen clones marching — in "uniform," as the marketers say —into the global mall. Despite the
embrace of polyethnic imagery, market-driven globalization doesn't want diversity; quite the
opposite. Its enemies are national habits, local brands and distinctive regional tastes. Fewer interests
control ever more of the landscape.
Dazzled by the array of consumer choices, we may at first fail to notice the tremendous
consolidation taking place in the boardrooms of the entertainment, media and retail industries.
Advertising floods us with the kaleidoscopic soothing images of United Streets of Diversity and
Microsoft's wide-open "Where do you want to go today?" enticements. But in the pages of the
business section, the world goes monochromatic and doors slam shut from all sides: every other
story— whether the announcements of a new buyout, an untimely bankruptcy, a colossal merger —
points directly to a loss of meaningful choices. The real question is not "Where do you want to go
today?" but "How best can I steer you into the synergized maze of where I want you to go today?"
This assault on choice is taking place on several different fronts at once. It is happening
structurally, with mergers, buyouts and corporate synergies. It is happening locally, with a handful
of superbrands using their huge cash reserves to force out small and independent businesses. And it
is happening on the legal front, with entertainment and consumer-goods companies using libel and
trademark suits to hound anyone who puts an unwanted spin on a pop-cultural product. And so we
live in a double world: carnival on the surface, consolidation underneath, where it counts.
Everyone has, in one form or another, witnessed the odd double vision of vast consumer choice
coupled with Orwellian new restrictions on cultural production and public space. We see it when a
small community watches its lively downtown hollow out, as big-box discount stores with 70,000
items on their shelves set up on their periphery, exerting their gravitational pull to what James
Howard Kunstler describes as "the geography of nowhere.” I It is there on the trendy downtown
main street as yet another favourite cafe, hardware store, independent bookstore or art video house
is cleared away and replaced by one of the Pac-Man chains: Starbucks, Home Depot, the Gap,
Chapters, Borders, Blockbuster. It is there inside the big-box retail outlets each time a magazine is
taken off a shelf by a manager mindful of his bosses' corporate definition of "family values." You
can see it in the messy bedroom of a fourteen-year-old Web master who has just had her fan page
shut down by Viacom or EM1, unimpressed by her attempts to create her own little pocket of
culture with borrowed snippets of trademarked song lyrics and images. It is there again when
protesters are thrown out of shopping malls for handing out political leaflets, told by the security
guards that although the edifice may have replaced the public square in their town, it is, in fact,
private property.
A decade ago, any attempt to connect the dots among this mess of trends would have seemed
strange indeed: what does synergy have to do with the chain-store craze? What does copyright and
trademark law have to do with personal fan culture? Or corporate consolidation with freedom of
speech? But today, a clear pattern is emerging: as more and more companies seek to be the one
overarching brand under which we consume, make art, even build our homes, the entire concept of
public space is being redefined. And within these real and virtual branded edifices, options for
unbranded alternatives, for open debate, criticism and uncensored art — for real choice — are
facing new and ominous restrictions. If the erosion of noncorporate space explored in the last

section is feeding a kind of globo-claustrophobia that longs for release, then it is these restrictions
on choice — restricted by the same companies that promised a new age of freedom and diversity —
that are slowly focusing that potentially explosive longing on the multinational brands, creating the
conditions for the Anticorporate activism that will be explored later on in the book.

XdnAg$j+dgm}Xd/	edc
There is a distinctive quality to many of the chains that have proliferated during the eighties and
nineties —Ikea, Blockbuster, the Gap, Kinko's, the Body Shop, Starbucks —which sets them apart
from the fast-food restaurants, strip malls and muffler joints responsible for the sixties and
seventies franchise sprawl. They don't flash with the garish, cartoonlike plastic yellow shells and
golden arches; they are more apt to glow with a healthy New Age sheen. These crisp royal blue and
kelly green boxes snap together like pieces of Lego (the new kind that can make only one thing: the
model fire station or spaceship helpfully pictured on the box). The Kinko's, Starbucks and
Blockbuster clerks buy their uniform of khakis and white or blue shirts at the Gap; the "Hi!
Welcome to the Gap!" greeting cheer is fuelled by Starbucks double espressos; the resumes that got
them the jobs were designed at Kinko's on friendly Macs, in 12-point Helvetica on Microsoft Word.
The troops show up for work smelling of CK One (except at Starbucks, where colognes and
perfumes are thought to compete with the "romance of coffee" aroma), their faces freshly scrubbed
with Body Shop Blue Corn Mask, before leaving apartments furnished with Ikea self-assembled
bookcases and coffee tables.
The cultural transformation these institutions have effected is familiar to everyone, but there are
few helpful statistics available on the proliferation of franchises and chains, largely because most
research on retailing lumps franchises in with independent businesses. A franchise is technically
owned by the franchisee, even if every detail of the outlet — from the sign that hangs out front to
the precise temperature of the coffee — is controlled by a head office hundreds or even thousands
of miles away. Even without industrywide figures, it's undeniable that something very dramatic has
happened to the face of retail this decade. Take Starbucks, for instance. As recently as 1986, the
coffee company was a strictly local phenomenon, with a handful of cafes around Seattle. By 1992,
Starbucks had 165 stores with outlets in several U.S. and Canadian cities. By 1993, that number
had already gone up to 275, and in 1996, it reached 1,000. In early 1999, Starbucks hit 1,900 stores
with outlets in twelve countries, from the U.K. to Kuwait.
Blockbuster, another of the distinctly nineties chains, has enjoyed an even more dramatic expansion
rate over precisely the same time period. In 1985, Blockbuster was a lone video store in Dallas,
Texas. It was bought by waste-management czar Wayne Huizenga in 1987 and by 1989 there were
1,079 stores. In 1994, the year Huizenga sold Blockbuster to Viacom, there were 3,977. By early
1999, the number had reached 6,000, distributed over twenty-six countries, including 700 outlets in
the U.K. alone.
Similar patterns can be tracked for the Gap (and its holdings Banana Republic and Old Navy) and
the Body Shop, which averaged between 120 and 150 store openings a year through the mideighties to the present. Even Wal-Mart didn't truly find its feet as a retail powerhouse until the late
eighties. Although the first Wal-Mart outlet opened in 1962, the superstore model didn't take off
until 1988 and it wasn't until 1991 that Wal-Mart-by then opening 150 discount stores a year —
surpassed Kmart and Sears to become the most powerful force in American retailing.

This growth spurt was brought about by three industry trends, all of them dramatically favouring
big chains with deep cash reserves. The first is price wars, in which the biggest megachains
systematically undersell all their competitors; the second is the practice of blitzing out the
competition by setting up chain-store "clusters." The third trend, to be explored in the next chapter,
is the arrival of the palatial flagship superstore, which appears on prime real estate and acts as a
three-dimensional ad for the brand.

·B	ew3_7uºj+!n³]\^_7uºj+}OÁ­ñj+Bg<­ýJk?_!}
In mid-1999, Wal-Mart had 2,435 big-box discount stores in nine countries, selling everything from
Barbie Dream Homes to Kathie Lee Gifford skirts and handbags to Black & Decker drills to
Prodigy CDs. Of those stores, 565 were "Supercenters," a concept that combines Wal-Mart's
original discount model with full-service grocery stores, hair salons and banks, as well as 443 Sam's
Clubs, which offer even deeper discounts for bulk purchases and big-ticket items like office
furniture. The recipe that has made Wal-Mart the largest retailer in the world, hauling in $137
billion in sales in 1998, is straightforward enough. First, build stores two and three times the size of
your closest competitors. Next, pile your shelves with products purchased in such great volume that
the suppliers are forced to give you a substantially lower price than they would otherwise. Then cut
your in-store prices so low that no small retailer can begin to compete with your "everyday low
prices."
Because everything about the Arkansas-based retailer is premised on achieving an economy of
scale, an average Wal-Mart store measures 92,000 square feet, not including the requisite
substantial parking lot. Since discounting is its calling card, Wal-Mart must keep its overhead
down, which is why the lots for its windowless stores are purchased on the edges of towns, where
land is cheap and taxes are lower. Every year of Wal-Mart's expansion, its new stores have grown
bigger in size, and many of its original, comparatively modest discount outlets have been converted
and expanded into superstores, some as large as 200,000 square feet.
Another key element in keeping costs down is that Wal-Mart only opens outlets close to its
distribution centres. For this reason, Wal-Mart has spread like molasses: slow and thick. It won't
move into a new region until it has blanketed the last area with stores — as many as forty in a
hundred-mile radius. That way, the company saves money on transportation and shipping costs, and
develops such a concentrated presence in an area that advertising its brand is barely necessary. "We
would go as far as we could from a warehouse and put in a store. Then we would fill in the map of
that territory, state by state, county seat by county seat, until we had saturated the market area,"
Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton explained. Then the company would open up a new distribution
centre in a new region and repeat the process.
After Wal-Mart began in the U.S. South, plodding slowly through Arkansas, Oklahoma, Missouri
and Louisiana, it took a while before Wall Street and the Eastern-based media grasped the
magnitude of Sam Walton's project. For this reason, it wasn't until the early nineties, three decades
after the opening of the first Wal-Mart, that opposition to the big boxes began to mount. The
argument against Wal-Mart's retail style —by now almost as familiar as Wal-Mart itself—holds
that bargain prices lure shoppers to the suburbs, sucking community life and small businesses out

of the town centres. Smaller businesses can't compete —in fact, many of Wal-Mart's competitors
claim they pay more for their goods wholesale than Wal-Mart charges retail.
By now, there have been several books written about the effect of the big boxes, most notably In
Sam We Trust, by Wall Street Journal reporter Bob Ortega. As Onega notes, Wal-Mart is not alone
in its "size matters" approach to retailing —it is simply the leader in an exploding category of bigbox retailers who use their clout to wrangle special treatment. Home Depot, Office Depot and Bed,
Bath & Beyond, which are often grouped together in pumped-up strip malls called "power centres,"
are all known in the retail industry as "category killers" because they enter a category with so much
buying power that they almost instantly kill the smaller competitors.
This retail style has always been controversial and was responsible for the first anti-chain
movement, which arose in the 1920s. As discounters like A&P and Woolworth’s proliferated, small
merchants tried to make it illegal for chains to use their relative size to extract lower wholesale
prices and drive down retail prices. The rhetoric of the time, as Ortega points out, bears a striking
resemblance to the language of the grassroots opposition groups that have sprung up in dozens of
North American towns when the pending arrival of a new Wal-Mart outlet has been announced.
On the legal front, charges of monopolistic practices have been cropping up with growing
regularity, and not just against Wal-Mart. In September 1997, for instance, the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission found that Toys 'R' Us was guilty of illegally pressuring manufacturers not to supply
popular toys to other chains. Because Toys 'R' Us is the largest toy retailer in the world, the
manufacturers agreed; and consumers' options were reduced dramatically, along with their chances
to comparison shop. "Many toy manufacturers had no choice but to go along," said William Baer,
director of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Competition when the case was decided.
This was precisely the type of situation the FTC was hoping to avoid when, in 1997, it blocked a
planned merger between two huge office-supply chains — Staples and Office Depot — stating that
the consolidation would hurt competition.
Beyond spawning the category killer, Sam Walton's legacy has had other, further-reaching effects.
In many ways, it was the inhuman scale of the big boxes and their accompanying sprawl —the
streets without sidewalks, the shopping centres only accessible by car, the stores the size of small
hamlets with all the design flair of tool sheds — that set the stage for the other significant retail
trends of the decade. Discount stores were great for saving money but not for much else. And so, as
the big boxes expanded into seas of concrete on the edge of town, they generated a renewed hunger
for human-scale development; for the old-fashioned town square, for public gathering places that
allowed both large meetings and intimate conversation; for a kind of retail with more interaction
and more sensory stimulation. In other words, they laid the groundwork for Starbucks, Virgin
Megastores and Mike Town.
Where big boxes used their size to move previously unimaginable amounts of product, the new
retailers would use their size to fetishize brand-name goods, placing them on a pedestal as high as
Wal-Mart's discounts were low. Where the big boxes had swapped a sense of community values for
a discount, the branded chains would re-create it and sell it back — at a price.

"A Comforting Third Place" is the phrase Starbucks uses to promote itself in its newsletters and
evangelical annual reports. This is not just another non-space like Wal-Mart or McDonald's, it's an
intimate nook where sophisticated people can share
"coffee...community...camaraderie...connection." Everything about New Age chains like Starbucks
is designed to assure us that they are a different breed from the strip-mall franchises of yesterday.
This isn't dreck for the masses, it's intelligent furniture, it's cosmetics as political activism, it's the
bookstore as an "old-world library," it's the coffee shop that wants to stare deep into your eyes and
"connect."
But there's a catch. The need for more intimate spaces designed to tempt people to linger may
indeed provide a powerful counterpoint to the cavernous big boxes, but these two retail trends are
not as far apart as they appear at first. For instance, the mechanics of Starbucks' dizzying expansion
during the past thirteen years has more in common with Wal-Mart's plan for global domination than
the brand managers at the folksy coffee chain like to admit. Rather than dropping an enormous big
box on the edge of town, Starbucks' policy is to drop "clusters" of outlets in urban areas already
dotted with cafes and espresso bars. This strategy relies just as heavily on an economy of scale as
Wal-Mart's does and the effect on competitors is much the same. Since Starbucks is explicit about
its desire to enter markets only where it can "become the leading retailer and brand of coffee," the
company has concentrated its store-a-day growth in relatively few areas. Instead of opening a few
stores in every city in the world, or even in North America, Starbucks waits until it can blitz an
entire area and spread, to quote Globe and Mail columnist John Barber, "like head lice through a
kindergarten." It's a highly aggressive strategy, and it involves something the company calls
"cannibalization."
The idea is to saturate an area with stores until the coffee competition is so fierce that sales drop
even in individual Starbucks outlets. In 1993, for instance, when Starbucks had just 275 outlets
concentrated in a few U.S. states, per-store sales increased by 19 percent from the previous year. By
1994, store sales growth was only 9 percent, in 1996 it dipped to 7 percent, and in 1997 Starbucks
saw only a 5 percent sales growth; in new stores, it was as low as 3 percent. Understandably, the
closer the outlets get to each other, the more they begin to poach or "cannibalize" each other's
clientele — even in hyper-caffeinated cities like Seattle and Vancouver people can only suck back
so many lattes before they float into the Pacific. Starbucks' 1995 annual report explains: "As part of
its expansion strategy of clustering stores in existing markets, Starbucks has experienced a certain
level of cannibalization of existing stores by new stores as the store concentration has increased, but
management believes such cannibalization has been justified by the incremental sales and return on
new store investment." What that means is that while sales were slowing at individual stores, the
total sales of all the chain's stores combined continued to rise - doubling, in fact, between 1995 and
1997. Put another way, Starbucks the company was expanding its market while its individual
outlets were losing market share, largely to other Starbucks outlets.
It also helped Starbucks, no doubt, that its cannibalization strategy preys not only on other
Starbucks outlets but equally on its real competitors, independently run coffee shops and
restaurants. And, unlike Starbucks, these lone businesses can only profit from one store at a time.
The bottom line is that clustering, like big-boxing, is a competitive retail strategy that is only an
option for a large chain that can afford to take a beating on individual stores in order to reap a
larger, long-term branding goal. It also explains why critics usually claim that companies like
Starbucks are preying on small businesses, while the chains themselves deny it, admitting only that

they are expanding and creating new markets for their products. Both are true, but the chains'
aggressive strategy of market expansion has the added bonus of simultaneously taking out
competitors.
There have been other, more brazen ways in which Starbucks has used its size and deep pockets to
its competitive advantage. Until the practice began creating controversy a few years back,
Starbucks' real-estate strategy was to stake out a popular independent cafe in a well-trafficked,
funky location and simply poach the lease from under it. Several independent cafe owners in prime
locations are on record claiming that Starbucks went directly to their landlords and offered to pay
them higher rental payments for the same or adjacent spaces. For instance, Chicago's Scenes Coffee
House and Drama received an eviction notice after Starbucks rented a space in the shopping
complex where it was located. The coffee chain attempted a similar manoeuvre with Dooney's cafe
in Toronto, though Starbucks claims it was the landlord who made the initial approach. Starbucks
did gain control of Dooney's lease but the community protest was so strong that the company ended
up having to sublet the space back to Dooney's. These cutthroat real-estate practices hardly make
Starbucks unique as a developer: McDonald's has perfected the scorched-earth approach to
franchising, opening neighbouring franchises and mini-outlets at gas stations until an area is
blanketed. The Gap has also adopted the cluster approach to retailing, brand bombing key
neighbourhoods with multiple outlets of the Gap, Baby Gap, Gap Kids, Old Navy, Banana
Republic and in 1999 Gap Body stores. The idea is to make Gap's family of brands synonymous
with clothing in the same way that McDonald's is synonymous with hamburgers and Coke is
synonymous with soft drinks. "If you go to a supermarket, you would expect to find some
fundamental items. You would expect to find milk: non-fat, 1 percent, 2 percent, whole milk. You
would expect dates to be fresh.... I don't know why apparel stores should be any different," says
Mickey Drexler, Gap CEO.10 It's fitting that Drexler's model for the Gap's ubiquity is the
supermarket, since it was the first supermarket chains that pioneered the clustering expansion
model. After A&P launched its "economy stores" in 1913 (the prototype of the modern
supermarket), it quickly opened 7,500 outlets, then closed half of them after saturation had been
achieved and many competitors were forced out of business.
The Gap welcomes these comparisons with Coke, McDonald's and A&P, but Starbucks, because of
the nature of its brand image, strenuously rejects them." After all, the Gap's project is to take a
distinctive product — clothing — and brand it so completely that purchasing it from the Gap is as
easy as buying a quart of milk or a can of Coke. Starbucks, on the other hand, is in the business of
taking a much more generic product — a cup of coffee — and branding it so completely that it
becomes a spiritual/designer object. So Starbucks doesn't want to be known as a blockbuster, it
wants, as its marketing director Scott Bedbury says, to "align ourselves with one of the greatest
movements towards finding a connection with your soul."
Yet no matter how urbane the original concept may have been, the business of chains has a logic
and a momentum of its own, having very little to do with what it sells. It breaks down each of a
brand's elements — no matter how progressive and homespun —into a kit of easy-to-assemble bits
and parts. Just as the chains snap together like Lego, each chain outlet is made up of hundreds of its
own snappable parts. Within the logic of chains, it matters little whether those snappable parts are a
McDonald's deep fryer and a Hamburglar mannequin or the "four elemental icons" that form the
building blocks for each Starbucks store design: "Earth to grow. Eire to roast. Water to brew. Air

for aroma." A clone is a clone, whether it is moulded in the shape of an arch or a peace symbol, and
its purpose is still replication.
This process is even more apparent when the chains expand on the global stage. When retailers
move outside their countries of origin, Starbucks-style clustering melds with Wal-Mart-style price
wars to create a kind of "bulk clustering strategy." To keep prices low in a new market, chains like
Wal-Mart, Home Depot and McDonald's must carry with them their trump card of being volume
buyers; and in order to have the market clout to get lower prices than their competitors, they can't
dribble into countries one store at a time. Instead, it has become a favoured expansion tactic to buy
out an existing chain and simply move into its stores in one dramatic entrance, as Wal-Mart did
when it bought out 120 Woolco stores in Canada in 1994 and when it purchased the Wertkauf
GmbH hypermarket chain in Germany in 1997. Similarly, when Starbucks moved into the U.K. in
1998, it acquired the already existing Seattle Coffee Company and retrofitted its 82 stores as
Starbucks outlets.
For national companies looking to avoid becoming the prey of the global giants, it has become an
increasingly popular strategy to initiate pre-emptive mergers of their own between two or more
large national brands. In the name of nationalism and global competitiveness, they consolidate, lay
off staff and mimic American retail formulas. Mot surprisingly, they generally end up transforming
themselves into copies of the global brands they were attempting to block. That's what happened in
Canada when fear of Wal-Mart prompted the country's oldest department store chain, the Hudson's
Bay Company, to buy Kmart Canada, fold it in with Zellers, lay off six thousand workers and open
several lines of big-box discount outlets: one for furniture, one for home and bath and one for
discount clothing. "Wal-Mart executed better than either Kmart or Zellers. By merging the two
operations, we're going to learn how to execute better," said George Heller, president of Kmart.

The combination of the big-box and clustering approaches to retailing is having a transformative
effect on the retail landscape. Though they represent very different retail trends, the combined
effect of the Wal-Mart and Star-bucks models has been to gradually erode the market share of small
business in what was one of the few fields remaining where independent operators stood a solid
chance of competing head-to-head with multinationals. With the chains able to outbid smaller
competitors for space and supplies with barely a second thought, retail has become a battle of the
big spenders. Whether they are using their clout to drive prices down to impossibly low levels, to
keep them artificially high or simply to seize near monopolistic market shares, the net effect is the
same: a retail arena in which size is a prerequisite and small companies can barely maintain a
toehold. Like sumo wrestlers, the competitors in this game must push the limits of their weight
category; bigness begets bigness.
Of course independent stores and restaurants continue to open and thrive, but more and more, these
are high-end, specialty retailers in gentrified neighbourhoods, while the suburbs, small towns and
working-class neighbourhoods get blanketed in — and blasted by — the self-replicating clones.
This shift affects not only who can afford to stay in business but also (as I'll get into in Chapter 8)
what makes it onto the store's shelves.

There is another retail trend that is in many ways exerting an even more significant influence than
the two just discussed: the branded superstore, a marketplace marriage of the size power of big
boxes with the branding clout of the store clusters. As I'll show in the next chapter, the superstore is
the logical result of the corporate preoccupation with synergy: part marketing, part brand-extension
supermarket, part theme park.
All of these three retail phenomena, and the impact they are having on consumer choice, are about
much more than changes to the way we shop. They are key pieces of the branding puzzle that is
transforming everything, from the way we congregate to the way we work. In fact, the divide
between the bland big boxes at the edge of town and the branded castles and clusters in the centre
of town can be traced back to Marlboro Friday and its aftermath. These parallel developments are
the physical embodiment of the split that opened up between the lowly price-slashers and the
spiritual brand-builders. For its part, Wal-Mart stands as the single most powerful symbol of the
decline in brand value that sent Wall Street into a tailspin on that Friday in April 1993. The year
before the so-called brand crash was a record one for Wal-Mart, during which it opened 161 new
discount stores-unheard-of growth for the end of a recession. Wal-Mart's shoppers were the new
"value generation" in motion, flocking to the suburbs to avoid paying premium prices for heavily
marketed brands. If Wal-Mart was selling Tide at deep discounts, so much the better, but these
formerly brand-conscious shoppers were just as happy to take home detergent from Wal-Mart's
own private label, Great Value.
At the same time, the proliferation of Nike Towns, Disney Stores and Star-bucks clusters is
powerful evidence of a renewed reverence for a handful of elite lifestyle brands. For many of their
loyal consumers, no price is too high to pay for these branded goods and, in fact, merely buying the
products provides an insufficient relationship. Brand-obsessed shoppers have adopted an almost
fetishist approach to consumption in which the brand name acquires a talismanic power.
Not surprisingly, capitalizing on the urge for this sort of brand cocooning has become the central
preoccupation of the fashion, athletics and entertainment corporations selling these fetish brands.
Theme-park-inspired superstores are one part of this process, but as the successive waves of
mergers and attendant synergies continue, they are only the beginning.

I would prefer ABC not cover Disney.
-Disney CEO Michael Eisner, September 29, 1998, National Public Radio
Commenting on the future of poetry and art in a democratic society, Alexis de Tocqueville wrote
that he was not worried about a lapse into safe realism so much as a flight into unanchored fantasy.
"I fear that the productions of democratic poets may often be surcharged with immense and
incoherent imagery, with exaggerated descriptions and strange creations; and that the fantastic
beings of their brain may sometimes make us regret the world of reality."
We are surrounded now by the realization of Tocqueville's predictions: gleaming, bulbous golden
arches; impossibly smooth backlit billboards; squishy cartoon characters roaming fantastically fake
theme parks. When I was growing up, these strange creations awakened something in me that I've

since come to think of as deep longing for the seductions of fake; I wanted to disappear into shiny,
perfect, unreal objects.
Maybe this condition was brought on by television, maybe it was a too-early trip to Disneyland,
maybe it was malls, but just as Tocqueville predicted in 1835, the world of reality looked pretty
dingy by comparison. The humiliating spectacle of my all-too-real family, so sixties authentic, set
against the cascade of inviting plasticity that was the seventies and eighties, was simply too much
to bear. "Stop it, guys, you're embarrassing me!" was the near-hysterical cri de coeur of my youth.
Even when there was no one but family around, I could feel the plastic world's reproachful gaze.
My parents, part of a wave of American hippies who moved to Canada to dodge the Vietnam War
draft, were terribly disturbed by these tendencies of mine. In their newly adopted country, they had
imagined themselves to be breeding a new kind of post revolutionary child, blessed with the
benefits of Canada's humane social services, public health-care system and solid subsidies to the
arts. Hadn't they diligently mushed their own baby food? Read Parent Effectiveness Training?
Banned war toys and other "gendered" play?
In an effort to save me from corruption, my parents were forever dragging me out of the city to
appreciate the Canadian wilderness and experience the joys of real-time family interaction. I was
distinctly unimpressed. The only thing that saved me on these reality excursions was my dreams of
fakeness, unfolding in the back seat of our station wagon as it sped past verdant farmland and
majestic mountains. At five or six, I would eagerly await the moulded plastic of franchise signs on
the side of the road, craning my neck as we passed McDonald's, Texaco, Burger King. My favourite
was the Shell sign, so bright and cartoon-like I was convinced that if I could climb up and touch it,
it would be like touching something from another dimension -from the world of TV. During these
family trips, my brother and I would beg to stop for fast food packed in shiny laminated boxes, and
sometimes my parents would relent, if they were feeling particularly defeated that day. But more
often than not, lunch would be another ponchoed picnic at a national park, with dry cheddar cheese,
autumnal fruit and other distressingly un-packaged foodstuffs.
By the time I was eight or nine, my back-seat daydreams grew more intricate. I spent an entire
journey through the Rockies conducting covert make-overs on everyone in the car. My father would
lose the sandals and get a sharp, dignified suit, my mother a helmet hairdo and a wardrobe of smart
pastel blazers, skirts and matching pumps. As for me, the possibilities were endless: kitchen
cupboards filled with fake foods, closets overflowing with designer labels, unlimited access to
eyeliner and perms. I wasn't allowed to have a Barbie ("a racket," my parents ruled, "first it's a doll,
then a camper van, then the whole mansion") but I had Barbie in my brain.
It seemed as if the vanguard feminist-socialist child-rearing experiment was doomed to failure. Not
only was I crazy for Shell signs, but by the age of six, my older brother had developed an uncanny
knack for remembering the jingles from television commercials and would tear around the house in
his Incredible Hulk T-shirt declaring himself "cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs." At the time, I couldn't
understand why my parents were so upset about these stupid rhymes, but now I've come to feel
their pain: despite their very best efforts, they had somehow given birth to an advertisement for
General Mills — in other words, to regular kids.

Cartoons and fast-food franchises speak to children in a voice too seductive for mere mortal parents
to compete with. Every kid wants to hold a piece of the cartoon world between his or her fingers that's why the licensing of television and movie characters for toys, cereals and lunchboxes has
spawned a $16.1 billion annual industry. It is also why so-called family entertainment companies
have been going to greater and greater lengths to extend their television and movie fantasies into
real-world experiential extravaganzas: branded museum exhibits, high-tech superstores, and, the old
standard, theme parks. Back in the 1930s, Walt Disney, the grandfather of modern synergy,
understood the desire to crawl inside the screen when he fantasized about building a self-enclosed
Disney city and remarked that every Mickey Mouse product or toy doubled as an advertisement for
his cartoons. Mattel has long grasped this as well, but if Disney's project has been extending the
fantasy of its films into toys, then Mattel's was extending its toys into ever more elaborate fantasy
worlds. This vision is perhaps best understood as the "Zen of Barbie": Barbie is One. Barbie is all
things.
Which is to say that the corporate synergy mania consuming so much of pop culture today is not all
new. Barbie and Mickey Mouse are miniature branding trailblazers —those two have always
wanted more extensions for their brands, more lateral monopolies to control. What has changed in
the past decade is that almost everyone in the corporate world now recognizes that the urge to
disappear into the cross-promotional tie-ins of cherished consumer products (be they toys, TV
shows or sneakers) does not magically disappear when children outgrow sugar cereal. Plenty of
Saturday-morning-cartoon kids have grown up into Saturday-night-club kids, fulfilling their
longing for plastic fantasy with earnestly ironic Hello Kitty backpacks and Japanimation-inspired
helmets of blue hair. You can see some of them at the Sega Playdiums, which are filled with
grown-up gamers on weekend nights —no one under eighteen is even allowed to enter these roaring
carnivals of virtual reality, especially on South Park theme nights.
It is this insistent desire to become one with your favourite pop-culture products that every one of
the superbrands — from Nike to Viacom to the Gap to Martha Stewart —is trying to harness and
expand upon, exporting Walt Disney's synergy principles from kid culture and transplanting them
into every aspect of both teen and adult mass culture. Michael J. Wolf, a management consultant to
such major players as Viacom, Time Warner, MTV and Citigroup, can attest to that fact. "I can't
begin to count the number of times that people who run consumer businesses have confided to me
that their goal is to create the broad-based success that Disney seems to bring to every project and
every business it touches," he writes.
This goal didn't materialize out of thin air. Rather, it can be traced back once again to the corporate
"brands, not products" epiphany sparked by Marlboro Friday: if brands are about "meaning," not
product attributes, then the highest feat of branding comes when companies provide their
consumers with opportunities not merely to shop but to fully experience the meaning of their brand.
Sponsorship, as seen in Chapter 2, is a good start, but synergy and lifestyle branding are the logical
conclusion. Just as companies like Molson and Nike have sought to build celebrity brands by
upstaging the concerts and sports matches they sponsored, so are many of these same companies
also attempting to overthrow local retailers by creating branded superstores, then, further down the
road, branded hotels and miniature villages. As two sides of the same project, synergy and branding
are both about creating cross-promotional brand-based experiences that combine buying with
elements of media, entertainment and professional sports to create an integrated branded loop.
Disney and Mattel have always known this — now everyone else is learning it too.

A true branded loop cannot be created overnight, which is why the process usually begins with the
simplest form of brand extension, a giant merger: Bell Atlantic and Nynex; Digital Equipment and
Compaq; WordCom Inc. and MCI; Time Warner and Turner; Disney and ABC; Cineplex and
Loews; Citicorp and Travellers; Bertelsmann and Random House; Seagram and PolyGram;
America Online and Netscape; Viacom and CBS...the list grows each day. Usually, the companies
cite the Wal-Mart principle: everyone else in the industry is merging and only the biggest and
strongest will survive. But size for its own sake is only the beginning of the story. Once the
perimeter of the brand has expanded, corporate attention inevitably shifts to ways of making it more
self-sufficient, through various internally coordinated cross-promotions. In a word, through
synergy.
Sometime in the early nineties, writes Michael J. Wolf, the attitude of his media industry clients
underwent a philosophical change. "Companies were no longer interested in merely being the
biggest studio or the most successful TV network. They had to be more. Theme parks, cable
networks, radio, consumer products, books, and music all became prospects for their potential
empires. Media land was gripped by merger mania. If you weren't everywhere... you were
nowhere."
This sort of reasoning lies behind virtually all the major mergers of the mid- to late nineties. Disney
buys ABC, which then broadcasts its movies and cartoons. Time Warner purchases Turner
Broadcasting, which then cross-promotes its magazines and films on CNN. George Lucas buys
block stocks in Hasbro and Galoob before he sells the toy companies the licensing rights for the
new Star Wars films, at which point Hasbro promptly buys Galoob to consolidate its hold on the
toy market. Time Warner opens a division devoted to turning its films and cartoons into Broadway
musicals. Nelvana, a Canadian-based producer of kids' cartoons, purchases Kids Can Press, a
publisher of children's books upon which such lucrative Nelvana cartoons as Franklin the Turtle are
based. The merger transforms Nelvana into an "integrated company," in which future books can get
their genesis in the company's marketable TV cartoons and lucrative lines of toys.
In the broader book world, after purchasing Random House (this book's primary publisher),
Bertelsmann AG buys 50 percent of Barnesandnoble.com, giving the largest English-language
publishing company in the world a significant stake in the exploding on-line book retail market.
Barnes & Noble, meanwhile, bids to buy Ingram, a major American book distributor, which also
services the chain's competitors. If the Ingram deal had gone through (it was abandoned amid
public outcry), the potential synergies among these three companies would have stretched to
include the entire book publishing process, from contracting and editing to distributing, publicizing
and, finally, retailing.
Perhaps the purest expression of synergy's market goals was Viacom's 1994 purchase of
Blockbuster Video and Paramount Pictures. The deal gave Viacom the opportunity not only to
profit from Paramount films when they played in its Paramount theatres but when they came out on
video as well. "The combination of Viacom and Paramount, in my view, is the whole essence of the
multimedia revolution," says Sumner Redstone, the billionaire mogul behind Viacom. And this
ability to keep cash flows inside a corporate family carries for these moguls its own kind of reward.
Virgin's Richard Branson, for instance, laughs in the face of the accusation that his far-flung
branding forays are stretching the Virgin name in too many directions. "It may be right that Mars

sticks to the chocolate bar and Mike keeps its feet on the ground. But if their executives cross the
Atlantic on a Virgin plane, listen to Virgin records and keep their money with a Virgin bank, then at
least Britain will have one new global brand for the next century."
What the Virgin case clearly shows is that in the aftermath of the synergy revolution, brand
extensions are no longer adjuncts to the core product or main attraction; rather, these extensions
form the foundation upon which entire corporate structures are being built. Synergy, as Branson
suggests, is about much more than old-style cross-promotion; it is about using ever-expanding
networks of brand extensions to spin a self-sustaining lifestyle web. Branson and others are
stretching the fabric of their brands in so many directions that they are transformed into tent-like
enclosures large enough to house any number of core activities, from shopping to entertainment to
holidays. Starbucks, upon announcing that it would begin selling furniture over the Internet, calls
this a "brand canopy." This is the true meaning of a lifestyle brand: you can live your whole life
inside it.
The concept is key to understanding not only synergy but also the related blurring of boundaries
between sectors and industries. Retail is blurring with entertainment, entertainment with retail.
Content companies (like film studios and book publishers) are leaping into distribution; distribution
networks (like phone and Internet companies) are leaping into content production.
And all the while, the people previously pigeonholed as pure content — the stars themselves — are
charging into production, distribution and, of course, retail. So the "if you aren't everywhere, you're
nowhere" sentiment described by Wolf reaches well beyond the media conglomerates. Everyone, it
seems, wants to be everywhere —whether they started as home decorators, sneaker manufacturers,
record companies or basketball stars, they are all ending up, as Shaquille O'Neal and his people so
aptly put it, "like Mickey Mouse."
In this fluid context, the branded tent of tents might be Disney or Viacom, but it could just as easily
be Tommy Hilfiger, America Online, Martha Stewart or Microsoft. Quite simply, every company
with a powerful brand is attempting to develop a relationship with consumers that resonates so
completely with their sense of self that they will aspire, or at least consent, to be serfs under these
feudal brandlords. This explains why marketing talk of pitch and product has been usurped so
completely by the more intimate discourse of "meaning" and "relationship building" —brand-based
companies are no longer interested in a consumer fling. They want to move in together.
And so the fiercest marketplace battles are taking place not between warring products but between
warring branded camps that are constantly redrawing the borders around their enclaves, pushing the
boundaries to include ever more complete lifestyle packages: if music, why not food, asks Puff
Daddy. If clothes, why not retail, asks Tommy Hilfiger. If retail, why not music, asks the Gap. If
coffee houses, why not publishing, asks Starbucks. If theme parks, why not towns, asks Disney.

Not surprisingly, it was the Walt Disney Company, the inventor of modern branding, that created
the model for the branded superstore, opening the first Disney Store in 1984. There are now close
to 730 outlets worldwide. Coke followed shortly after with a store sporting all manner of branded
paraphernalia, from key chains to cutting boards. But if Disney and Coke paved the way, it was

Barnes & Noble that created the model that would forever change the face of retailing, introducing
the first superstore to its chain of bookstores in 1990. The prototype for the new construct,
according to company documents, was "old-world library ambiance and a wood and green palette"
complemented by "comfortable seating, restrooms and extended hours" —and, of course, by a little
co-branding in the form of in-store Starbucks coffee shops. The formula affected not only the
chain's ability to sell books but also the role it occupied in pop culture; it became a celebrity, a
source of endless media controversy, and eventually the thinly veiled inspiration for a Hollywood
movie, You've Got Mail. In less than a decade, Barnes & Noble became the first bookstore that was
also a superbrand in its own right.
Little wonder, then, that virtually all the consumer and entertainment companies that have been
building up their brand images through marketing, synergy and sponsorship are now intent on
having their own retail temples. Nike, Diesel, Warner Brothers, Tommy Hilfiger, Sony, Virgin,
Microsoft, Hustler and the Discovery Channel have all leaped into branded retail. For these
companies, stores that sell multiple brands have become antithetical to the very principles of sound
brand management. They want nothing to do with venues in which their products are sold side by
side with their competitors'. "The multi-brand store is disappearing, and companies like us need
stores that reflect our personality," explains Maurizio Marchiori, advertising director at Diesel,
which has opened twenty branded stores since 1996.
I’m really very, very disappointd that I didn’t move into the hretail business years ago, because I never realised the
marketing power if the Hustler name and logo. – Hustler owener Larry Flynt, The New York Times, March 21, 1999

The superstores constructed to reflect these corporate personalities are exploring the boundaries of
what Nike refers to as "inspirational retail." As Nike president Thomas Clarke explains, large-scale
"event" outlets "give retailers the opportunity to romance products better." How this seduction takes
place varies from brand to brand, but the general idea is to create a venue that is part shopping
centre, part amusement park, part multimedia extravaganza — an advertisement more potent and
evocative than a hundred billboards. Popular superstore attractions include deejays spinning live
from their own in-house broadcast booths, giant screens and star-studded launch parties. A cut
above are the listening booths at the Virgin Megastores, the indoor waterfalls and rock-climbing
walls at Seattle's Recreational Equipment, Inc., the interactive digital foot-measuring stations at
Nike Town, the complimentary foot massages and reflexology at Rockport stores and the arcadestyle computer games at the San Francisco Microsoft Store. And then, of course, there is that
fixture of branded retail: the in-store coffee bar — even the Hustler superstore has one of those.
Describing his vision for the 9,000-square-foot branded sex emporium in West Hollywood, Hustler
owner Larry Flynt explained that he wanted to create a retail space "more comfortable for women,
more like Barnes £t Noble."
"Creating a destination" is the key buzz-phrase for the superstore builder: these are places not only
to shop but also visit, places to which tourists make ritualistic pilgrimages. For this reason, the
locations chosen for the stores are far more upmarket than those to which the hawkers of Disney
key chains, Nike sneakers and Tommy jeans are accustomed. In fact, so many mass-market brand
Mecca’s have made their home on New York's Fifth Avenue and L.A.'s Rodeo Drive that the
neighbours — the exclusive Gucci, Cartier and Armani brands — have begun to complain about the
popularizing presence of Daffy Duck and Air Jordan.

Selling mass-market consumer goods and doodads on the most expensive pieces of real estate in the
world, in the most costly, high-tech, art-directed retail environments ever imagined, doesn't always
add up on paper. But to look at the superstore as a break-even business enterprise is to miss the
point entirely. No expense is spared in the building of the stores because, while the Time Square
Disney Store or the Fifth Avenue Warner Brothers outlet may be money losers in and of
themselves, they serve a much higher purpose in the overall branding picture. As Dan Romanelli,
president of Warner Brothers consumer products division, says of the company's flagship, "Fifth
and 57th is probably the best retail location in the world. It has helped immensely in building our
international business and in making a statement about our brand." Discovery Communication
takes a similar attitude. Spinning off from its four television channels, the media company has
launched thirty-five Discovery shops since 1996, hybrids of department stores, amusement parks
and museums. The jewel in the crown is a $20 million flagship store in Washington, D.C., that
features a full-scale model of a T. rex dinosaur skeleton and a World War 11 fighter plane.
According to Michela English, president of Discovery Enterprises Worldwide, these outlets are not
expected to make money until at least 2001. That, however, isn't stopping the company from adding
dozens more stores. "There is a billboard impact to having the Discovery name on stores," she
explains.
Generally, this "billboard impact" is favoured by companies whose primary source of sales is still
multibrand venues: department stores, Cineplex Theatres, THMV record stores, Foot Locker and so
on. Even without being able to control their entire distribution networks, branded superstores
provide these companies with a kind of spiritual homeland for their brands, one so recognizable and
grand that no matter where the individual products roam they will carry that grandness with them
like a halo. It is as if a homing device had been implanted in the brand, so that, for instance, stalls
selling Virgin merchandise at Virgin movie theatres aren't stalls selling merchandise at movie
theatres — they are "Virgin mini-megastores," a satellite of something much deeper and more
important than what meets the eye. And when consumers go to the local Foot Locker and are
confronted with pairs of Nikes unceremoniously lined up next to the Reeboks, Filas and Adidas,
they will, with any luck, remember the sensory overload they experienced on their pilgrimage to
Nike Town. As Michael Wolf writes, branded retail is about "imprinting an experience on you as
surely as the farmer's wife imprints good feelings in a clutch of baby geese when she feeds them a
handful of grain every day."

	edc	ed/g$g$^_7`ij+dk
The stores are only the beginning — the first phase in an evolution from experiential shopping to
living the fully branded experience. In a superstore, writes Wolf, "the lights, the music, the
furniture, the cast of clerks create a feeling not unlike a play in which you, the shopper, are given a
leading role." But in the scheme of things that play is rather short: an hour or two at the most.
Which is why the next phase after retail-as-tourist-destination has been the creation of branded
holidays: never mind Disney World, Disney has launched the Disney Magic cruise ship and among
its destinations is Disney's privately owned island in the Bahamas, Castaway Cay. Nike has its own
sports-themed cruise ship in the works and Roots Canada, shortly after introducing a home wear
line and opening a flagship store in Manhattan, launched the Roots Lodge, a branded hotel in
British Columbia.

I visited the Roots development at the construction phase in Ucluelet, a small town on the west
coast of Vancouver Island. The site is called the Reef Point Resort and it is here that branding is
being taken to the next level. In April 1999, the Roots Lodge wasn't yet open, but construction was
far enough along to make the concept perfectly clear: a high-end, fully branded summer camp for
adults. Instead of canoes, an "adventure station" rents out ocean kayaks and surfboards; instead of
outhouses, each cabin has its own hot tub; instead of the communal campfire, individual gas
fireplaces. The lodge restaurant is set up mess-hall style, but the food is pure Pacific Coast gourmet.
Most important, the rough-hewn wooden cabins are equipped with the entire Roots home furniture
line.
"Like living in a billboard," one visitor observes as we receive our official tour, and that is no
exaggeration. A cross between a catalogue showroom and an actual living room, the resort has a
Roots logo on display in the cabins on pillows, towels, cutlery, plates and glasses. The chairs, sofas,
rugs, blinds and shower curtains are all Roots. On the wooden Roots coffee table is a brown leather
Roots blotter, gently cradling a flattering book about the Roots story - and you can buy it all to take
with you at the Roots store across the way. At the lodge, the "play" Wolf refers to lasts not a few
hours but a weekend, maybe even a week or two. And the set at the company's disposal includes not
only the architecture and design of the buildings (as is the case with superstores), but the entire
Canadian wilderness around the lodge: the eagle in the cedar outside the window, the old-growth
forest that guests walk through to reach the cabins, the crashing waves of the Pacific.
There is a strong symmetry at work in this branding exercise. The Roots clothing line got its
genesis in a place not unlike this one. Company founders Don Green and Michael Budman both
went to summer camp in Algonquin Park, Ontario, and were so moved by their experience of active
living in the Canadian outdoors that they designed a line of clothing to capture the very best of that
feeling: comfortable walking shoes, cozy sweatshirts, Canadian Workman socks, and, of course, the
beaver logo. "Algonquin's majestic hills, sparkling lakes and forest primeval inspired Roots," states
an early print advertisement. "Its golden summer days, cold starry nights, autumn blaze and still
winter white are now recreated in the colours and spirit of Roots Algonquin."
The pitch was anything but subtle, as journalist Michael Posner observed in 1993 when he wrote,
"Here's the truth: Roots is less a company than a summer camp." The clothing manufacturer has
been expanding on that carefully crafted image since the beginning. First it built retail outlets that,
with the help of wall-mounted canoe paddles and exposed beams, conjure not a chain store but, as
journalist Geoff Pevere writes, "summer-camp mess halls and cottages built by caring and callused
hands." Then came the home wear line, featuring blankets and pillowcases designed to look like
oversized workmen's socks. And now, full circle, comes the Roots Lodge, where the original
"inspiration" for a line of clothing becomes a fully realized extension of the Roots brand: from
summer camp to branded camp; from lifestyle marketing to the lifestyle itself.
Mark Consiglio, the fast-talking, fleece-wearing developer of the resort, has bigger plans still for
Reef Point, of which the Roots Lodge represents only a fraction of the available property. He shows
me a model for a 250-cabin complex and explains his vision: a retail town centre with brand-name
stores and services. The Roots store, of course, but perhaps an Aveda Spa as well, and maybe stores
like Club Monaco and the Body Shop too. Each retail outlet will be attached by boardwalk to its
very own branded lodge, which, like the Roots Lodge, will be kitted with all the logo-festooned

accessories the company can supply. Consiglio can't name names yet — "still in negotiations"—but
he does tell me pointedly that "Roots isn't the only clothing company getting into home wear, you
know. Everyone is doing it."
The problem with branded vacation destinations, however, is that they only provide temporary
opportunities for brand convergence, an oasis from which families, at the end of the trip, are
abruptly yanked and dumped back into their old lives, no doubt a poorly managed mishmash of
competing logos and brand identities. Which is where Celebration, Florida, comes in —that very
first Disney town. The meticulously planned development arrives complete with picket fences, a
Disney-appointed homeowners' association and a phoney water tower. For the families who live
there year-round, Disney has achieved the ultimate goal of lifestyle brandling; for the brand to
become life itself.
Except the life on offer is perhaps not the One we might have expected from the Mouse. When
Walt Disney first conceived of a branded city, it was meant to be an artificiality bonanza, a temp]e
to the mid-fifties futuristic gods of technology and automation. The city never was built in Walt's
lifetime, though some of the ideas went into the Epcot Centre sixteen years after his death. When
Disney CEO Michael Eisner decided to pick up on Walt's old dream and build a branded town he
opted against the Jetsons-inspired fantasy world his predecessor had imagined. Though wired with
every modern technology and convenience, Celebration is less futurism than homage, an idealized
re-creation of the liveable America that existed before malls, big-box sprawl, freeways, amusement
parks and mass commercialization. Oddly enough, Celebration is not even sales vehicle for Mickey
Mouse licensed products; it is, in contemporary terns an almost Disney-free town - no doubt the
only one left in America. In other words, when Disney finally reached its fully enclosed,
synergized, self-sufficient space, it chose to create a pre-Disneyfied world- its calm, understated
aesthetics are the antithesis of the cartoon world for sale down the freeway at Disney World.
Like the gated communities that have Sprung up across the U.S., on Celebration's tranquil, treelined, billboard-free streets inhabitants are not subject to any of the stimulations or ravages of
contemporary life. No Levi Strauss has bought up all the storefronts on Main Street to sell a new
style of wide-legged pants, and no graffiti artists have defaced the ads; no Wal-Mart has left the
downtown boarded up and twisted, and no community group has formed to fight the big boxes; no
factory closures have eroded the tax base and pumped up the welfare rolls and no quarrelsome
critics are around to point fingers. What is most striking about Celebration, however, particularly
when compared with most Northern American suburban communities, is the amount of public
space it offers - parks, communal buildings and village squares. In a way, Disney's branding
breakthrough is a celebration of brandlessness, of the very public spaces the company has always
been so adept at getting its brands on in the rest of its endeavours.
Of course this is an illusion. The families who have chosen to make Celebration their home are
leading the first branded lives. As social historian Dieter Hassenpflug has remarked, "Even the
streets are under Disney's control—private space that pretend[s] to be public." So Celebration is an
intricate inversion of Tocqueville's prediction: an "authenticity" bunker, specially retrofitted by the
founder of fake.
The whole idea reminds me of a place on Vancouver Island called Cathedral Grove, about an hour
and half s drive from the Roots Lodge and the mouth of Clayoquot Sound, Canada's most cherished

old-growth forest. The drive through this part of the world has converted thousands of unsuspecting
tourists into environmental activists, and it's easy to see why. After driving uphill for miles you
reach a vista of mountains covered with lush cedars, sparkling lakes and drifting eagles —the
wilderness that soothes and reassures the soul. The planet is as strong and rich as it ever was, it tells
us —we just have to drive farther north to see it. But the serenity doesn't last long. The next dip and
climb brings a radically different view: two huge bald grey mountains so burned and scarred they
look more like the moon's surface than the earth. Nothing but death and asphalt for miles.
Nestled in the folds of this psychic roller coaster is the entrance to Cathedral Grove. Every day,
hundreds of cars pull over to the side of the road, and their passengers embark on foot, glossy
brochures in hand, to see the only old-growth trees left in the area. The largest tree has a rope
around it and a plaque mounted on a stick. The irony, not lost on most residents of the area, is that
this miniature park is owned and operated by MacMillan Bloedel, the logging company responsible
for clear-cutting Vancouver Island and much of Clayoquot Sound. Cathedral Grove isn't a forest but
a tree museum —just as Celebration is a town museum.
It's tempting to dismiss Celebration and the idea of the branded town as the particular neurotic
obsession of the Disney corporation: this isn't a harbinger of the future privatization of public
space, it's just Walt playing God again from beyond the grave. But with virtually every superbrand
openly modelling itself after Disney, Celebration should not be too readily dismissed. Of course
Disney is ahead of the game — Disney invented the game — but as is always the case with the
Mouse, there are many would-be imitators trailing behind, taking notes. From his perch as adviser
to the top media conglomerates, Michael J. Wolf observes that theme-park-style shopping locations
like Minneapolis's Mall of America may be precursors to the live-in malls of the future. "Maybe the
next step in this evolution is to put housing next to the stores and megaplexes and call it a small
town. People living, working, shopping, and consuming entertainment in one place. What a
concept," he enthuses.
Setting aside, for a moment, the Brave New World/Step ford Wives associations such a vision
inevitably evokes, there is something undeniably seductive about these branded worlds. It has to do,
I think, with the genuine thrill of utopianism, or the illusion of it at any rate. It's worth remembering
that the branding process begins with a group of people sitting around a table trying to conjure up
an ideal image; they toss around words like "free," "independent," "rugged," "comfortable,"
"intelligent," "hip." Then they set out to find real-world ways to embody those ideas and attributes,
first through marketing, then through retail environments like superstores and coffee chains, then
— if they are really cutting edge — through total lifestyle experiences like theme parks, lodges,
cruise ships and towns.
Why wouldn't these creations be seductive? We live in a time when expectations for building realworld commons and monuments with pooled public resources —schools, say, or libraries or parks
—are consistently having to be scaled back or excised completely. In this context, these private
branded worlds are aesthetically and creatively thrilling in a way that is totally foreign to anyone
who missed the post-war boom. For the first time in decades, groups of people are constructing
their own ideal communities and building actual monuments, whether it's the marriage of work and
play at the Nike World Campus, the luxurious intellectualism of the Barnes & Noble superstores or
the wilderness fantasy of the Roots Lodge. The emotional power of these enclaves rests in their

ability to capture a nostalgic longing, then pump up the intensity: a school gym equipped with
NBA-quality equipment; summer camp with hot tubs and gourmet food; an old-world library with
designer furniture and latte; a town with no architectural blunders and no crime; a museum with the
deep pockets of Hollywood. Yes, these creations can be vaguely spooky and sci-fi, but they should
not be dismissed as just more crass commercialism for the unthinking masses: for better or for
worse, these are privatized public Utopias.

The terrible irony of these surrogates, of course, is how destructive they are proving to be to the real
thing: to actual town centres, to independent business, to the non-Disney version of public spaces,
to art as opposed to synergized cultural products and to a free and messy expression of ideas.
Commercial climates are being dramatically altered by the expanding size and ambitions of these
large players, and nowhere more so than in retail, where, as we have seen, companies like
Discovery and Warner Brothers are in it for the "billboard effect" as much as for the sales.
Independent shopkeepers, on the other hand, generally lack the resources to turn shopping into
performance art, let alone into a destination vacation spot.
As superstores adopt the production values and special effects of Hollywood, small business is
getting caught between, on the one hand, the deep discounting of the Wal-Marts and on-line
retailers like Amazon.com, and on the other the powerful draw of the theme-park-infused retail
environments. These market trends are combining to drastically undermine the traditional concepts
of value and individual service that small business is known for offering. The staff at the indies may
be more experienced and knowledgeable than the assistants at the superstores (the high turnover
doesn't allow clerks to gain experience: more on that in the next section, "No Jobs"), but even that
relative advantage can often get drowned out by the pure entertainment value of the superstores.
As many have commented, this phenomenon has been particularly pronounced in the book
industry, where membership in the American Booksellers Association has fallen startlingly from
5,132 in 1991 to 3,400 in 1999. part Of the problem is the Wal-Mart effect: the superstore chains
have negotiated discounts on wholesale books with many publishers, making it nearly impossible
for the independents to compete on price. The other difficulty is the retail standard set by the
superstores. Bookstores are now expected to play the role of the university library, theme park,
playground, pickup joint, community centre, literary salon and coffee house all in one-a pricey
undertaking even for the big players, which often involves taking a loss in the interest of future
brand equity and market share. That has been the experience here in Canada, where the Canadian
equivalent of Barnes & Noble, the bookstore chain Chapters, was able to open ten superstores in
prime locations in 1997, while running at a loss of $2.1 million.
It is here, once again, that the economy of scale comes powerfully into play. Of course some
independent bookstores have held their own against the chains by adding cafes, cozy reading chairs
and cooking demonstrations, but there is only so far most independents can travel down the road of
experiential shopping before they experience financial stress. If, on the other hand, they do nothing
to compete, single, independent stores can all too soon begin to look like poor cousins next to the
brandstravaganza unfolding across the street. The end result is a retail playing field where more
books are being sold, but it is becoming as difficult for small retailers to compete as it is for

independent film producers to go up against the major studios on the multiplex circuit. Retail has
become a vastly unequal playing field; yet another industry-like film, television or software - where
you have to be huge to stay in the game. Here once again is the strange combination of a sea of
product coupled with losses in real choice: the signature of our branded age.
A great deal of critical attention has been lavished on the effects of superstores on the book
industry-partly because bookstore consolidation has clear implications for freedom of speech, and
partly because media types tend to care more passionately about where they buy their books than
where they buy their socks. In many ways, however, the bookstores are an anomaly in the
superstore universe: they are multibrand stores, carrying books from thousands of book publishers,
and they are primary business ventures, as opposed to being extensions, synergy schemes or 3-D
billboards for brands primarily invested elsewhere. To see the animosity toward marketplace
diversity most directly, one has to look not to the bookstores but to the pure branded superstores
like those built by Virgin, Sony and Nike. It is there that the quest for total brand reach is revealed
most starkly as the antithesis of marketplace diversity: like synergy itself, these stores seek namebrand cohesion, a safe logo cocoon apart from the warring messages of other brands.
The Virgin megastores provide perhaps the clearest displays of this kind of brand cohesion,
employing various intra-brand synergies to leapfrog over entire stages of consumer choice. In the
past, record labels, no matter how much money they sank into promoting new artists, were still at
the mercy of record-store owners and radio- and music-video station programmers (which is why
the labels got themselves into so much legal trouble in the fifties for bribing deejays). No more.
Virgin's 122 megastores are wired up to be synergy machines, equipped with building-sized mural
ads, listening stations for customers to sample new CDs, huge video screens, deejay booths, and
satellite dishes to beam live concerts into the stores. This is par for the course in the age of the
superstore, but since Virgin is also a record label, all of this technology can be harnessed to create a
sense of breaking excitement about a new Virgin artist. "We'll be featuring certain artists every
month. That means we play them in the store, we can do live shows via satellite from another
location and we can give them store presence," says Christos Garkinos, vice president of marketing
for Virgin Entertainment Group. "Think of what we can do for a developing artist." More to the
point, why wait around for something as temperamental as audience demand or radio play when by
controlling all the variables you can create the illusion of a blockbuster success before it even
happens?
That is synergy, in a nutshell. Microsoft uses the term "bundling" to describe the expanding
package of core goods and services included in its Windows operating system, but bundling is
simply the software industry's word for what Virgin calls synergy and Nike calls brand extensions.
By bundling the Internet Explorer software within Windows, one company, because of its near
monopoly in system software, has attempted to buy its way in as the exclusive portal to the Internet.
What the Microsoft case so clearly demonstrates is that the moment when all the synergy wheels
are turning in unison and all's right in the corporate universe is the very moment when consumer
choice is at its most rigidly controlled and consumer power at its feeblest. Similarly, in the
entertainment and media industries, synergy nirvana has been attained when all of a conglomerate's
arms have been successfully coordinated to churn out related versions of the same product, like
moulded Play-Doh, into different shapes: toys, books, theme parks, magazines, television specials,
movies, candies, CDs, CD-ROMs, superstores, comics and mega musicals.

Because synergy's efficiency is not measured by the success of any one "product," whether a film or
a book, but rather on how well any one of those products travels through the conglomerate's
multimedia channels, synergy projects tend to grow out of freewheeling meetings in which agents,
clients, brand managers and producers riff on how next to leverage their flagship brands. And so the
market is flooded with the mutant progeny of these brainstorming sessions: Planet Hollywood
restaurants, Disney-published books written by ABC sitcom stars, Starbucks coffee-flavoured beer,
Lost in Space breath mints, a chain of airport bars modelled after the deceased set of the sitcom
Cheers, Taco Bell-flavoured Doritos...
It seems fitting, then, that Sumner Bedstone calls his Viacom entertainment products "software"
since there is so little that is firm at the centre of these synergy schemes. By software, Redstone
means branded entertainment products that he pats and moulds to fit his various media holdings.
"We have created a software-driven media global powerhouse," he says. "Our mission is to drive
that software in every application here in the U.S. and to every region on the earth. We're going to
do it." Redstone prides himself on the "absolute open communication" between his holdings. "We
are coordinating various aspects of the business so each takes advantage of the opportunities
provided by the other."

In less enthusiastic eras than our own, other words besides "synergy" were commonly used to
describe attempts to radically distort consumer offerings to benefit colluding owners; in the U.S.,
illegal trusts were combinations of companies that secretly agreed to fix prices while pretending to
be competitive. And what else is a monopoly, after all, but synergy taken to the extreme? Markets
that respond to the tyranny of size have always had a tendency toward monopoly. Which is why
much of what has taken place in the entertainment industry during the last decade of merger mania
would have been outlawed as recently as 1982, before President Ronald Reagan's all-out assault on
U.S. anti-trust laws.
Although many media empires have long had the capacity to coordinate their holdings to promote
their various offerings, most were held in check from aggressively doing so by laws designed to put
up barriers between media production and media distribution. For example, U.S. regulations passed
between 1948 and 1952 limited the ability of film studios to own first-run movie theatres because
lawmakers feared a vertical monopoly in the industry. Though the regulations were loosened in
1974, the U.S. government was at that point in the midst of implementing a similar series of antitrust actions designed to keep the three major U.S. television networks (CBS, ABC and NBC) from
producing entertainment shows and movies for their own stations. The Justice Department charged
that the three networks had an illegal monopoly that was blocking the work of outside producers.
According to the Justice Department, the networks should act as programming "conduits," not
programmers themselves. During this government anti-trust campaign, CBS was forced to sell off
its programming arm —which, ironically, is now the synergy-obsessed Viacom. Another irony is
that the interest that pushed most aggressively for the Federal Trade Commission investigation was
Westinghouse Broadcasting, the same company that merged with CBS in 1995 and now enjoys all
the attendant synergies between production and distribution. Full circle arrived in September 1999
when Viacom and CBS announced their merger, worth an estimated $80 billion. The companies,
reunited after all these years apart, converged into an entity far more powerful than before the
divorce took place.

In the seventies and early eighties, however, the majors were under so much scrutiny that according
to Jack Myers, then a sales executive at CBS-TV, his network was reluctant to coordinate the sales
departments of its television, radio, music and publishing divisions for cross-promotional purposes.
"The idea," writes Myers, "is one that several major media companies are today attempting to
follow, but in 1981 concerns about anti-trust regulations prevented direct divisional interaction."
Those concerns were alleviated when, in 1983, Reagan began the not-so-gradual dismantling of
U.S. anti-trust laws, first opening the door to joint research between competitors, then removing the
roadblocks to giant mergers. He yanked the teeth out of the Federal Trade Commission,
dramatically limiting its ability to impose fines for anticompetitive actions, cutting the staff from
345 to 134 and appointing an FTC chairman who prided himself on reducing the agency's
"excessively adversarial role." A former FTC regional director, Carlton Eastlake, commented in
1983 that "if the policies of the current chairman are permitted to govern for a sufficient period of
time, some of our most basic liberties will be jeopardized." Mot only were the policies continued,
but in 1986 even more dismantling legislation was passed with the explanation that American
companies needed greater flexibility to compete with the Japanese. Reagan's term saw the ten
biggest mergers in American history up until that point —and not one was challenged by the FTC.
The number of FTC anti-trust cases against corporations dropped by half during the eighties, and
the cases that were prosecuted tended to target such ultra-powerful forces as the Oklahoma
Optometric Association, at the same time as Reagan stepped in personally to protect the world's ten
largest airlines from a pending anti-trust investigation by his own government. For the culture
industries, the final piece of the new-world jigsaw fell into place in 1993 when Federal Judge
Manuel Real lifted the anti-trust restrictions that had been imposed on the three major television
networks in the seventies. The decision opened the door for the majors to once again produce their
own prime-time entertainment shows and movies and neatly paved the way for the Disney-ABC
merger.
However, even in today's climate of weak anti-trust laws, some of the more audacious synergy
dreams have begun to wake up the long-dormant FTC. In addition to the high-profile case against
Microsoft, Barnes & Noble's bid to buy the book distributor Ingram created such rage in the book
industry that the FTC was forced to set up a dedicated phone line to deal with the complaints and
Barnes & Noble abandoned the bid. That these controversies are fiercest in the book and software
industries is no coincidence: what is at stake is not the availability of cheap staplers, toys or nonbranded towels but the free publication of, and access to, a healthy diversity of ideas. It doesn't help
that the concentration of ownership among Internet, publishing and book retail companies has come
hot on the heels of what must now seem an incautious level of hype about the openness and
personal empowerment of the so-called Information Revolution.
In an open E-mail to Bill Gates, Andrew Shapiro, a Fellow at Harvard Law School's Centre for
Internet and Society, voices an opinion that has surely occurred to most thoughtful observers of
modern mergers and synergy schemes. "If the whole idea of this revolution is to empower people,
Bill, why are you locking up the market and restricting choices? Synergizing your way from one
biz to another every month?"

This contradiction represents a much larger betrayal than the usual doublespeak of advertising that
we are all accustomed to. What is being betrayed is no less than the central promises of the
information age: the promises of choice, interactivity and increased freedom.

CHAPTER EIGHT
CORPORATE CENSORSHIP

`j+3B	ew4j+k/	-d?cZg$^_\`ij+d?k_3k¨	e}O}«j+c_
Every other week I pull something off the shelf that I don't think is of Wal-Mart quality.
— Teresa Stanton, manager of Wal-Mart's store in Cheraw, South Carolina,
on the chain's practice of censoring magazines with provocative covers, in
The Wall Street Journal, October 22, 1997

In some instances, the assault on choice has moved beyond predatory retail and monopolistic
synergy schemes and become what can only be described as straightforward censorship: the active
elimination and suppression of material. Most of us would define censorship as a restriction of
content imposed by governments or other state institutions, or instigated —particularly in North
American societies —by pressure groups for political or religious reasons. It is rapidly becoming
evident, however, that this definition is drastically outdated. Although there will always be a Jesse
Helms and a Church Lady to ban a Marilyn Manson concert, these little dramas are fast becoming
sideshows in the context of larger threats to free expression.
Corporate censorship has everything to do with the themes of the last two chapters: media and retail
companies have inflated to such bloated proportions that simple decisions about what items to stock
in a store or what kind of cultural product to commission — decisions quite properly left to the
discretion of business owners and culture makers — now have enormous consequences: those who
make these choices have the power to reengineer the cultural landscape. When magazines are
pulled from Wal-Mart's shelves by store managers, when cover art is changed on CDs to make
them Kmart-friendly, or when movies are refused by Blockbuster Video because they don't
conform to the chain's "family entertainment" image, these private decisions send waves through
the culture industries, affecting not just what is readily available at the local big box but what gets
produced in the first place.
Both Wal-Mart and Blockbuster Video have their roots in the southern U.S. Christian heartlandBlockbuster in Texas, Wal-Mart in Arkansas. Both retailers believe that being "family" stores is at
the core of their financial success, the very key to their mass appeal. The model (also adopted by
Kmart), is to create a one-size-fits-all family-entertainment centre, where Mom and Dad can rent
the latest box-office hit and the new Garth Brooks release a few steps away from where Johnny can
get Tomb Raider 2 and Melissa can co-angst with Alanis.
To protect this formula, Blockbuster, Wal-Mart, Kmart and all the large supermarket chains have a
policy of refusing to carry any material that could threaten their image as a retail destination for the
whole family. The one-stop-shopping recipe is simply too lucrative to risk. So magazines are
rejected by Wal-Marts and supermarket chains —which together account for 55 percent of U.S.

newsstand sales — for offences ranging from too much skin on the cover girls, to articles on "His &
Her Orgasms" or "Coming Out: Why I Had to Leave My Husband for Another Woman." WalMart's and Kmart's policy is not to stock CDs with cover art or lyrics deemed overly sexual or
touching too explicitly on topics that reliably scandalize the heartland: abortion, homosexuality and
Satanism. Meanwhile, Blockbuster Video, which controls 25 percent of the home-video market in
the U.S., carries plenty of violent and sexually explicit movies but it draws the line at films that
receive an 1MC-17 rating, a U.S. designation meaning that nobody under seventeen can see the
film, even accompanied by an adult.
To hear the chains tell it, censoring art is simply one of several services they provide to their
family-oriented customers, like smiling faces and low prices. "Our customers understand our music
and video merchandising decisions are a common-sense attempt to provide the type of material they
might want to purchase," says Dale Ingram, Wal-Mart director of corporate relations. Blockbuster's
line is: "We respect the needs of families as well as individuals."
Wal-Mart can afford to be particularly zealous since entertainment products represent only a
fraction of its business anyway. No one hit record or movie has the power to make a dent in WalMart's bottom line, a fact that makes the retailer unafraid to stand up to the entertainment industry's
best-selling artists and defend its vision of a shopping environment where power tools and hip-hop
albums are sold in adjoining aisles. The most well known of these cases involved the chain's refusal
to carry Nirvana's second hit album, In Utero, even though the band's previous album had gone
quadruple platinum, because it objected to the back-cover artwork portraying foetuses. "Country
artists like Vince Gill and Garth Brooks are going to sell much better for Wal-Mart than Nirvana,"
Wal-Mart spokesperson Trey Baker blithely said at the time. Facing a projected loss of 10 percent
(Wal-Mart's then share of U.S. music sales), Warner and Nirvana backed down and changed the
artwork. They also changed the title of the song "Rape Me" to "Waif Me." Kmart Canada took a
similar attitude to the Prodigy's 1997 release Fat of the Land, on the basis that the cover art and the
lyrics in the songs "Smack My Bitch Up" and "Funky Shit" just wouldn't fit in at the Mart. "Our
typical customer is a married working mother and we felt it was inappropriate for a family store,"
said manager Alien Letch. Like Nirvana, the British bad boys complied with their label's
subsequent request and issued a cleaned-up version.
Such censorship, in fact, has become so embedded in the production process that it is often treated
as simply another stage of editing. Because of Blockbuster's policy, some major film studios have
altogether stopped making films that will be rated NC-17. If a rare exception is made, the studios
will cut two versions — one for the theatres, one sliced and diced for Blockbuster. What producer,
after all, would be willing to forgo 25 percent of video earnings before their project is even out of
the gate? As film director David Cronenberg told The New Yorker, "The assumption now seems to
be that every movie should be watchable by a kid.... So the pressure on anyone who wants to make
a grownup movie is enormous."
Many magazines, including Cosmopolitan and Vibe, have taken to showing advance copies of new
issues to big boxes and supermarkets before they ship them out. Why risk having to deal with the
returns if the issue is deemed too risqué? "If you don't let them know in advance, they will delist the
title and never carry it again," explains Dana Sacher, circulation director of Vibe.
"This way, they don't carry one issue, but they might carry the next one."

Since bands put out a record every couple of years - not one a month -they don't have the luxury of
warning Wal-Mart about a potentially contentious cover and hoping for better luck on the next
release. Like film producers, record labels are instead acting pre-emptively, issuing two versions of
the same album — one for the big boxes, bleeped, airbrushed, even missing entire songs. But while
that has been the strategy for multi-platinum-selling artists like the Prodigy and Nirvana, bands
with less clout often lose the opportunity to record their songs the way they intended, pre-empting
the objections of family-values retailers by issuing only pre-sanitized versions of their work.
In large part, the complacency surrounding the Wal-Mart and Blockbuster strain of censorship
occurs because most people are apt to think of corporate decisions as non-ideological. Businesses
make business decisions, we tell ourselves — even when the effects of those decisions are clearly
political. And when retailers dominate the market to the extent that these chains do today, their
actions can't help raising questions about the effect on civil liberties and public life. As Bob Merlis,
a spokesperson for Warner Brothers Records explains, these private decisions can indeed have very
public effects. "If you can't buy the record then we can't sell it," he says. "And there are some places
where these mass merchandisers are the only game in town." So in much the same way that WalMart has used its size to get cheaper prices out of suppliers, the chain is also using its heft to change
the kind of art that its "suppliers" (i.e., record companies, publishers, magazine editors) provide.

While the instances of corporate censorship discussed so far have been a direct by-product of retail
concentration, they represent only the most ham-fisted form of corporate censorship. More subtlyand perhaps more interestingly- the culture industry's wave of mergers is breeding its own
blockages to free expression, a kind of censorship in synergy.
One of the reasons that producers are not standing up to puritanical retailers is that those retailers,
distributors and producers are often owned, in whole or in part, by the same companies. Nowhere is
this conflict of interest more in play than in the relationship between Paramount Films and
Blockbuster Video. Paramount is hardly positioned to lead the charge against Blockbuster's
conservative stocking policy, because if indeed such a policy is the most cost-effective way to draw
the whole family into the video store, then who is Paramount to take money directly out of mutual
owner Viacom's pockets? Similar conflicts arise in the aftermath of Disney's 1993 purchase of
Miramax, the formerly independent film company. On the one hand, Miramax now has deep
resources to throw behind commercially risky foreign films like Roberto Benigni's Life Is
Beautiful; on the other, when the company decides whether or not to carry a politically
controversial and sexually explicit work like Larry Clarke's Kids, it cannot avoid weighing how that
decision will reflect on Disney and ABC's reputations as family programmers, with all the bowing
to pressure groups that that entails.
Such potential conflicts become even more disturbing when the media holdings involved are not
only producing entertainment but also news or current affairs. When newspapers, magazines, books
and television stations are but one arm of a conglomerate bent on "absolute open communication"
(as Sumner Redstone puts it), there is obvious potential for the conglomerate's myriad financial
interests to influence the kind of journalism that is produced. Of course, newspaper publishers
meddling in editorial content to further their own financial interests is as old a story as the small-

town paper owner who uses the local Herald or Gazette to get his buddy elected mayor. But when
the publisher is a conglomerate, its fingers are in many more pots at once. As multinational
conglomerates build up their self-enclosed, self-promoting worlds, they create new and varied
possibilities for conflict of interest and censorship. Such pressures range from pushing the
magazine arm of the conglomerate to give a favourable review to a movie or sitcom produced by
another arm of the conglomerate, to pushing an editor not to run a critical story that could hurt a
merger in the works, to newspapers being asked to tiptoe around judicial or regulatory bodies that
award television licenses and review anti-trust complaints. And what is emerging is that even
tough-minded editors and producers who unquestioningly stand up to external calls for censorship
— whether from vocal political lobbies, Wal-Mart managers or their own advertisers — are finding
these intracorporate pressures much more difficult to resist.
The most publicized of the synergy-censorship cases occurred in September 1998 when ABC News
killed a Disney-related story prepared by its award-winning investigative team of correspondent
Brian Ross and producer Rhonda Schwartz. The story began as a broad investigation of allegations
of lax security at theme parks and resorts, leading to the inadvertent hiring of sex offenders,
including paedophiles, as park employees.
Because Disney was to be only one of several park owners under the microscope, Ross and
Schwartz got the go-ahead on the story. After all, it wasn't the first time the team had faced the
prospect of reporting on their parent company. In March 1998, ABC newsmagazine 20/20 had aired
their story about widespread sweatshop labour in the U.S. territory of Saipan. Though it focused its
criticism on Ralph Lauren and the Gap, the story did mention in passing that Disney was among the
other American companies contracting to the offending factories.
But reporting has a life of its own and as Ross and Schwartz progressed on the theme-park
investigation, they found that Disney wasn't on the periphery, but was at the centre of this story.
When they handed in two drafts of what had turned into a sex-and-scandal expose of Disney World,
David Westin, president of ABC News, rejected the drafts. "They didn't work," said network
spokeswoman Eileen Murphy. Even though Disney denies the allegations of lax security, first made
in the book Disney: The Mouse Betrayed, and even though CEO Michael Eisner is on record saying
"I would prefer ABC not cover Disney," ABC denies the story was killed because of pressure from
its parent company. Murphy did say, however, that "we would generally not embark on an
investigation that focused solely on Disney, for a whole variety of reasons, one of which is that
whatever you come up with, positive or negative, will seem suspect."
The most vocal criticism of the affair came from Brill's Content, the media-watch magazine
founded in 1998 by Steven Brill. The publication lambasted ABC executives and journalists for
their silence in the face of censorship, accusing them of caving in to their own internalized "MouseKe-Fear." In his previous incarnation as founder of the Court TV cable network and American
Lawyer magazine, Steven Brill had some firsthand experience with censorship in synergy. After
selling his miniature media empire to Time Warner in 1997, Brill claims that he faced pressure on
several different stories that brushed up against the octopus-like tentacles of the Time Warner/
Turner media empire. In a memo excerpted in Vanity Fair, Brill writes that company lawyers tried
to suppress a report in American Lawyer about a Church of Scientology lawsuit against Time
magazine (owned by Time Warner) and asked Court TV to refrain from covering a trial involving
Warner Music. He also claims to have received a request from Time Warner's chief financial

officer, Richard Bressler, to "kill a story" about William Baer, the director of the Federal Trade
Commission's Bureau of Competition — ironically, the very body charged with reviewing the Time
Warner-Turner merger for any violation of anti-trust law.
Despite the alleged meddling, all the stories in question made it to print or to air, but Brill's
experience still casts a shadow over the future of press freedom inside the merged giants. Individual
crusading editors and producers have always carried the flag for journalists' right to do their job, but
in the present climate, for every crusader there will be many more walking on eggs for fear of
losing their job. And it's not surprising that some have begun to see trouble everywhere, secondguessing the wishes of top executives in ways more creative and paranoid than the executives may
even dare to imagine themselves. This is the truly insidious nature of self-censorship: it does the
gag work more efficiently than an army of bullying and meddling media moguls could ever hope to
accomplish.

As we have seen in recent years, journalists, producers and editors are not only finding reason to
walk carefully when dealing with judicial and regulatory bodies (not to mention theme parks), but
—in the case of China—we have watched an entire country become a tiptoe zone. A wave of
China-chill incidents has swept through the Western media and entertainment industries since Deng
Xiaoping tentatively lifted the Communist Party monopoly on news and began slowly to open his
country's borders to some censor-approved foreign media and entertainment.
Mow the global culture industry faces the possibility that it is the West that may have to play by
China's rules — outside as well as inside its borders. Those rules were neatly summed up in a 1992
article in The South China Morning Post: "Provided they do not break the law or go against party
line, journalists and cultural personnel are guaranteed freedom from interference by commissars
and censors." And with TOO million cable subscribers expected in China by the year 2000, several
cultural empire builders have already begun exercising their freedom to agree with the Chinese
government.
An early incident involved Rupert Murdoch's notorious decision to drop the BBC's World Service
news from the Asian version of Star TV. Chinese authorities had objected to a BBC broadcast on
Mao Tse-tung, sending a clear warning about the types of reporting that will be welcome and
profitable in China's wired world. More recently, HarperCollins Publishers (this book's publisher in
the United Kingdom), also owned by Murdoch's Mews Corp, decided to drop East and West:
China, Power, and the Future of Asia, written by Hong Kong's last British governor, Chris Patten.
At issue was the possibility that the views expressed by Patten—who had called for more
democracy in Hong Kong and criticized human-rights abuses in China — would enrage the Chinese
government upon which Murdoch's satellite ventures are dependent. In the storm of controversy
that followed, more allegations of censorship for the sake of global synergy came out of the
woodwork, including one by Jonathan Mirsky, former East Asia editor for the Murdoch-owned
London Times. He claimed that the paper "has simply decided, because of Murdoch's interests, not
to cover China in a serious way."
Fears of retaliation from the Chinese are not without basis. Famous for punishing media
organizations that don't toe the government line and rewarding those that do, the Chinese

government banned the sale and ownership of private satellite dishes in October 1993: the dishes
were picking up more than ten foreign stations, including CNN, BBC and MTV. Liu Xilian, vice
minister for radio, film and television, would only say, "Some of the satellite programs are suitable
and some are not suitable for the normal public." The Chinese government fired another salvo in
December 1996 after learning of Disney's plans to release Kundun, a Martin Scorsese film about
Tibet's Dalai Lama. "We are resolutely opposed to the making of this movie. It is intended to
glorify the Dalai Lama, so it is an interference in China's internal affairs," stated Kong Min, an
official at the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television. When the studio went ahead with the film
anyway, Beijing instituted a ban on the release of all Disney films in China, a ban that stayed in
place for two years.
Since China only lets in ten foreign films a year and puts controls on their distribution, the Kundun
incident sent a chill through the film industry, which had several other China-related projects in the
works, including MGM's Red Corner and Sony's Seven Years in Tibet. To their credit, none of the
studios pulled the plug on these films in progress, and in fact many in the film community rallied
around Scorsese and Kundun. However, both MGM and Sony made official statements that
attempted to depoliticize their China films, even if it meant contradicting their lead actors and
directors. MGM went ahead with Red Corner, a movie about China's corrupt criminal justice
system, starring Richard Gere, but while Gere maintained that the film is "a different angle of
dealing with Tibet," MGM's worldwide marketing president, Gerry Rich, told a different story:
"We're not pursuing a political agenda. We're in the business of selling entertainment." Seven Years
in Tibet got a similar sell from Sony: "You don't want to convey that it's a movie about a political
cause," a studio executive said. Disney, meanThe medium will change from while, finally

If anything, the Western lust for access to the Chinese entertainment market has only become more
intense in recent years, despite worsening relationships between the U.S. and Chinese governments
over such issues as access to China's securities and telecommunications industries, more revelations
of espionage and, most disastrous of all, the accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade during the Kosovo war. The reason, in part, is that in the past, the desire to enter China
was based on projected earnings, but in 1998, those projections became a reality. James Cameron's
Titanic broke all the records for foreign releases and earned $40 million at the box office in China,
even in the midst of an economic downturn.
China chill is significant above all in what it tells us about the priorities and power wielded today
by the multinationals. Financial self-interest in business is nothing new, nor is it in itself

destructive. What is new is the reach and scope of these megacorporations' financial self-interest,
and the potential global consequences, in both international and local terms. These consequences
will be felt not in boisterous celebrity standoffs between such players as Rupert Murdoch, Michael
Eisner, Martin Scorsese and Chris Patten, all of whom have the resources and clout to advance their
positions regardless of minor setbacks. Disney and News Corp are moving swiftly ahead in China,
yet Tibet remains a cause celebre among movie stars and musicians, while Patten's book, after
quickly finding another publisher, certainly sold more copies as a result of the controversy. Rather,
the lasting effects, once again, will be in the self-censorship that the media conglomerates are now
in a position to seed down through the ranks of their organizations. If news reporters, editors and
producers have to take into account their moguls' expansionist agendas when reporting on foreign
affairs, why stop at China? Wouldn't coverage of the Indonesian government's genocide in East
Timor raise concerns for any multinational doing, or hoping to do, business in populous Indonesia?
What if a conglomerate has deals in the works in Nigeria, Colombia or Sudan? This is a long way
from the rhetoric following the fall of the Berlin Wall, when the media moguls claimed that their
cultural products would carry the torch of freedom to authoritarian regimes. Not only does that
mission appear to have been swiftly abandoned in favour of economic self-interest, but it seems that
it may be the torch of authoritarianism that is being carried by those most determined to go global.

After NATO's 1999 air strikes provoked Serbian "rock rallies" where teens in Chicago Bulls caps
defiantly burned the American flag, few would be naive enough to reassert the tired old refrain that
MTV and McDonald's are bringing peace and democracy to the world. What was crystallized in
those moments when pop culture bridged the wartime divide, however, was that even if there exists
no other cultural, political or linguistic common ground, Western media have made good on the
promise of introducing the first truly global lexicon of imagery, music and icons. If we agree on
nothing else, virtually everyone knows that Michael Jordan is the best basketball player that ever
lived.
That may seem a minor achievement compared with the grand "global village" pronouncements
made after the collapse of Communism, but it is an accomplishment sufficiently vast to have
revolutionized both the making of art and the practicing of politics. Verbal or visual references to
sitcoms, movie characters, advertising slogans and corporate logos have become the most effective
tool we have to communicate across cultures —an easy and instant "click." The depth of this form
of social branding came into sharp focus in March 1999 when a scandal erupted over a popular
textbook used in American public schools. The Grade 6 math text was riddled with mentions and
photographs of well-known brand-name products: Nike shoes, McDonald's, Gatorade. In one
instance, a word problem taught students to calculate diameters by measuring an Oreo cookie.
Predictably, parents' groups were furious over this milestone in the commercialization of education;
here was a textbook, it seemed, with paid advertorial. But McGraw-Hill, the book's publisher,
insisted that the critics had it all wrong. "You're trying to get into what people are familiar with, so
they can see, hey, mathematics is in the world out there," Patricia S. Wilson, one of the book's
authors, explained. The brand-name references weren't paid advertisements, she said, but an attempt
to speak to students with their own references and in their own language-to speak to them, in other
words, in brands.

Nobody is more acutely aware of how enmeshed language and brands have become than the brand
managers themselves. Cutting-edge trends in marketing theory encourage companies not to think of
their brands as a series of attributes but to look at the psychosocial role they play in pop culture and
in consumers' lives. Cultural anthropologist Grant McCracken teaches corporations that to
understand their own brands they have to set them free. Products like Kraft Dinner, McCracken
argues, take on a life of their own when they leave the store —they become pop-culture icons,
vehicles for family bonding, and creatively consumed expressions of individuality. The most recent
chapter in this school of brand theory comes from Harvard professor Susan Fournier, whose paper,
"The Consumer and the Brand: An Understanding within the Framework of Personal
Relationships," encourages marketers to use a human-relationship model in conceptualizing the
brand's place in society: is it a wife through an arranged marriage? A best friend or a mistress? Do
customers "cheat" on their brand or are they loyal? Is the relationship a "casual friendship" or a
"master/slave engagement"? As Foumier writes, "this connection is driven not by the image the
brand 'contains' in the culture, but by the deep and significant psychological and socio-cultural
meanings the consumer bestows on the brand in the process of meaning creation."
So here we are, for better or for worse, having meaningful committed relationships with our
toothpaste and co-dependencies on our conditioner. We have almost two centuries' worth of brandname history under our collective belt, coalescing to create a sort of global pop-cultural Morse
code. But there is just one catch: while we may all have the code implanted in our brains, we're not
really allowed to use it. In the name of protecting the brand from dilution, artists and activists who
try to engage with the brand as equal partners in their "relationships" are routinely dragged into
court for violating trademark, copyright, libel or "brand disparagement" laws —easily abused
statutes that form an airtight protective seal around the brand, allowing it to brand us, but
prohibiting us from so much as scuffing it.
Much of this comes back to synergy. The definition of trademark in U.S. law is "any word, name,
symbol, or device, or combination thereof, used...to identify and distinguish goods from those
manufactured or sold by others." Many alleged violators of copyright are not trying to sell a
comparable good or pass themselves off as the real thing. As branding becomes more expansionist,
however, a competitor is anyone doing anything remotely related, because anything remotely
related has the potential to be a spin-off at some point in the synergistic future.
And so, when we try to communicate with each other by using the language of brands and logos,
we run the very real risk of getting sued. In the U.S., copyright and trademark laws —strengthened
by Ronald Reagan in the same piece of 1983 legislation that loosened anti-trust law —are being
invoked in ways that have far more to do with brand control than market competition. Of course
there are many uses of these laws that are absolutely crucial if artists are to have a hope of making a
living, particularly with the growing ease of digital and electronic distribution. Artists need to be
protected from outright thievery of their work by competitors and from its use for commercial
profit without permission. I do know a few anti-copyright radicals who walk around in "All
Copyright Is Theft" and "Information Wants to Be Free" T-shirts, though it seems to me that those
positions are more provocative than practical. But what they do serve to highlight, if only
rhetorically, is the climate of cultural and linguistic privatization being advanced through outright
copyright and trademark harassment.

Copyright and trademark harassment is a massive and growing industry, and though its effects are
too sweeping to fully document, here are a few random examples. Dairy Queen bakers won't squirt
Bart Simpson onto frozen birthday cakes for fear of a lawsuit from Fox; in 1991, Disney forced a
group of New Zealand parents in a remote country town to remove their amateur renditions of Pluto
and Donald Duck from a playground mural; and Barney has been breaking up children's birthday
parties across the U.S., claiming that any parent caught dressed in a purple dinosaur suit is violating
its trademark. The Lyons Group, which owns the Barney character, "has sent 1,000 letters to shop
owners" renting or selling the offending costumes. "They can have a dinosaur costume. It's when
it's a purple dinosaur that it's illegal, and it doesn't matter what shade of purple, either," says Susan
Elsner Furman, Lyons' spokesperson.
McDonald's, meanwhile, continues busily to harass small shopkeepers and restaurateurs of Scottish
descent for that nationality's uncompetitive predisposition toward the Mc prefix on its surnames.
The company sued the McAllan's sausage stand in Denmark; the Scottish-themed sandwich shop
McMunchies in Buckinghamshire; went after Elizabeth McCaughey's McCoffee shop in the San
Francisco Bay Area; and waged a twenty-six-year battle against a man named Ronald McDonald
whose McDonald's Family Restaurant in a tiny town in Illinois had been around since 1956.
These types of cases may seem trivial, but the same aggressive ownership rules apply to artists and
cultural producers who are attempting to comment on our shared branded world. Increasingly,
musicians are sued not only for sampling, but for attempting to sing about a patented common
dream. That's what happened to the San Francisco "audio-collage" band Negativland when it called
one of its albums [72, and sampled out-takes from Casey Kasem's American Top 40 radio show. It
happened, also, to Toronto avant-garde musician John Oswald when he used his "plunderphonics"
method to remix Michael Jackson's song "Bad" on a 1989 album that he distributed free.
Negativland was sued successfully by U2's label, Island Records, and Jackson's label, CBS
Records, sued Oswald for copyright violation. As part of the settlement Oswald had to hand over all
the CDs to be destroyed.
Artists will always make art by reconfiguring our shared cultural languages and references, but as
those shared experiences shift from firsthand to mediated, and the most powerful political forces in
our society are as likely to be multinational corporations as politicians, a new set of issues emerges
that once again raises serious questions about out-of-date definitions of freedom of expression in a
branded culture. In this context, telling video artists that they can't use old car commercials, or
musicians that they can't sample or distort lyrics, is like banning the guitar or telling a painter he
can't use red. The underlying message is that culture is something that happens to you. You buy it
at the Virgin Mega store or Toys 'R' Us and rent it at Blockbuster Video. It is not something in
which you participate, or to which you have the right to respond.
The rules of this one-way dialogue went unchallenged for a long time, mostly because until the
eighties, copyright and trademark cases were largely between corporate competitors suing each
other for infringing on their market share. Artists like REM, the Clash, Dire Straits and K.D. Lang
were free to sing about such trademarked products as Orange Crush, Cadillacs, MTV and
Chatelaine magazine, respectively. Moreover, the average consumer didn't have the means to cut
and click into mass-produced culture and incorporate it into something new of their own — a zine,
a High-8 video or an electronic recording. It wasn't until scanners, cheap photocopiers, digital
editing machines and computer programs like Photoshop appeared on the market as fairly

inexpensive consumer goods that copyright and trademark law became a concern for independent
culture-makers assembling their own basement publications, Web sites and recordings. "I think that
culture has always cyclically reiterated itself.... Technology makes it possible to have access to and
easily manipulate and store information from distant places and times," says audio pirate Steev
Hise. "People will do what they can do."
Doing what he could do is what produced John Oswald's plunderphonics method. As Oswald
explains, it grew out of the fact that he had access to technology that enabled him to listen to
records at different speeds. "I was doing a kind of manipulative listening in fairly complex ways,
and as my interactive listening habits grew more complex, I began to think of ways to preserve
them for other people to hear."
What most bothers Oswald and other artists like him is not that their work is illegal — it's that it is
illegal only for some artists. When Beck, a major-label artist, makes an album parked with
hundreds of samples, Warner Music clears the rights to each and every piece of the audio collage
and the work is lauded for capturing the media-saturated, multi-referenced sounds of our age. But
when independent artists do the same thing, trying to cut and paste together art from their branded
lives and make good on some of the info-age hype about D1Y culture, it's criminalized — defined
as theft, not art. This was the point made by the musicians on the 1998 Deconstructing Beck
underground CD, produced entirely by electronically recontextualizing Beck's already
recontextualized sounds. Their point was simple: if Beck could do it, why shouldn't they? Right on
cue, Beck's label sent out threatening lawyers' letters that quieted down abruptly when the
musicians made it clear that they were gunning for a media fight. Their point, however, had been
made: the prevailing formula for copyright and trademark enforcement is a turf war over who is
going to get to make art with the new technologies. And it seems that if you're not on the team of a
company large enough to control a significant part of the playing field, and can't afford your very
own team of lawyers, you don't get to play.
This is the lesson, it would seem, of Mattel's copyright suit against the Danish pop band Aqua and
its label MCA. Mattel charged that the band's hit song "Barbie Girl" —which contains lyrics like
"Kiss me here, touch there, hanky panky" — wrongfully sexualizes its wholesome blonde. Mattel
went to court in September 1997 charging Aqua with trademark infringement and unfair
competition. The toy manufacturer asked for damages and for the album to be removed from stores
and destroyed. Aqua won the dispute but not because its case was any stronger than Negativland's
or John Oswald's (it might have been weaker) but rather because, unlike these independent
musicians, Aqua had behind it MCA's team of lawyers, willing to fight tooth and nail to make sure
the hit single was allowed to stay on the charts and the shelves. It was, like Jordan versus Nike, a
battle of the brands.
Although the music itself is pure cotton candy, the Aqua case is worth considering because it
pushed the envelope on copyright bullying, introducing the idea that musicians must now be wary
not only of direct sampling but of so much as mentioning any trademarked products. It also
highlighted the uncomfortable tension between the expansive logic of branding —the corporate
desire for full cultural integration — and the petty logic of these legal crusades. Who if not Barbie
is as much cultural symbol as product? Barbie, after all, is the archetypal space invader, a cultural
imperialist in pink. She is the one who paints entire towns fuchsia to celebrate "Barbie Month." She

is the Zen mistress who for the past four decades has insisted on being everything to young girls —
doctor, bimbo, teenager, career girl, Unicef ambassador....
The people at Mattel weren't interested in talking about Barbie the cultural icon when they launched
the Aqua suit, however. "This is a business issue, not a freedom of speech issue," a Mattel
spokesperson told Billboard. "This is a $2 billion company, and we don't want it messed around
with, and situations like this gradually lead to brand erosion." Barbie is a for-profit enterprise, it's
true. And brands such as Barbie, Aspirin, Kleenex, Coca-Cola and Hoover have always walked a
fine line between wanting to be ubiquitous but not wanting to become so closely associated with a
product category that the brand name itself becomes generic —as easily invoked to sell a
competing brand as their own.
But while this fight against erosion seems reasonable in the context of brands competing with each
other, it's a different matter when looked at through the lens of aggressive lifestyle branding —and
from that perspective, a re-examination of the public's right to respond to these "private" images
seems urgently required. Mattel, for instance, has reaped huge profits by encouraging young girls to
build elaborate dream lives around their doll, but it still wants that relationship to be a monologue.
The toy company, which boasts of having "as many as 100 different [trademark] investigations
going on at any time throughout the world," is almost comically aggressive in protecting this
formula. Among other feats, its lawyers have shut down a riot girl zine called Hey There, Barbie
Girl! and successfully blocked the distribution of Todd Haynes's documentary Superstar: The Karen
Carpenter Story, a re-enactment of the life of the anorexic pop star using Barbies as puppets (legal
pressure also came from Carpenter's family).
It seems fitting that Aqua member Sren Rasted says he got the idea for the song "Barbie Girl" after
visiting "an art-museum exhibition for kids on Barbie." In an effort to have its star doll inaugurated
as a cultural artefact, Mattel has in recent years been mounting travelling exhibits of old Barbies,
which claim to tell the history of America through "America's favourite doll." Some of these shows
are put on directly by Mattel, others by private collectors working closely with the company, a
relationship that ensures that unpleasant chapters in Barbie's history —the feminist backlash against
the doll, say, or Barbie the cigarette model — are mysteriously absent. There is no question that
Barbie, like a handful of other classic brands, is an icon and artefact in addition to being a children's
toy. But Mattel — and Coca-Cola, Disney, Levi's and the other brands that have launched similar
self-curatorial projects — wants to be treated as an important pop-culture artefact at the same time
as it seeks to maintain complete proprietary control over its historical and cultural legacy. It's a
process that ultimately gags cultural criticism, using copyright and trademark laws as effective tools
to silence all unwanted attention. The editors of Miller's, a magazine for Barbie collectors, are
convinced that Mattel targeted them with a copyright suit because, unlike the uncritical collectors
mounting Barbie art shows, the publication criticized Mattel's high prices and ran old photographs
of Barbie posing with packs of Virginia Slims cigarettes. Mattel is by no means unique in its
employment of this strategy. Kmart, for instance, shut down the Kmart Sucks Web site mounted by
a disgruntled employee, not by using libel or defamation law, which would have required that the
chain prove the allegations were false, but by suing for unauthorized use of its trademark K.
When copyright or trademark law can't be invoked to prevent an unwanted brand portrayal, many
corporations do rely on libel and defamation law to keep their practices from being debated in the
public realm. The high-profile "McLibel" case in Britain, in which the fast-food chain sued two

environmentalists for libel, was one such attempt. (The issue will be discussed in detail in Chapter
16.) Regardless of which legal tactic they choose, the impossibly contradictory message sent out by
the producers of these iconic products is the same: we want our brands to be the air you breathe in
— but don't dare exhale.
The more corporations like Mattel and McDonald's succeed in their goal of building self-enclosed
branded worlds, the more culturally asphyxiating that demand may become. Copyright and
trademark laws are perfectly justifiable if the brand in question is just a brand, but increasingly
that's like saying that Wal-Mart is just a store. The brand in question may well represent a
corporation with a budget larger than that of many countries, and a logo that is among the world's
most transcendent symbols, one that has aggressively sought to replace the role played by art and
media. When we lack the ability to talk back to entities that are culturally and politically powerful,
the very foundations of free speech and democratic society are called into question.

There is an unavoidable parallel between the privatization of language and cultural discourse
occurring through copyright and trademark bullying, and the privatization of public space taking
place through the proliferation of superstores, theme-park malls and branded villages like
Celebration, Florida. Just as privately owned words and images are being adopted as a de facto
international shorthand, so too are private branded enclaves becoming de facto town squares —
once again, with troubling implications for civil liberties.
The conflation of shopping and entertainment found at the superstores and theme-park malls has
created a vast grey area of pseudo-public private space. Politicians, police, social workers and even
religious leaders all recognize that malls have become the modern town square. But unlike the old
town squares, which were and still are sites for community discussion, protests and political rallies,
the only type of speech that is welcome here is marketing and other consumer patter. Peaceful
protestors are routinely thrown out by mall security guards for interfering with shopping, and even
picket lines are illegal inside these enclosures. The town-square concept has recently been picked
up by the superstores, many of which now claim that they too are providing public space.
"Essentially, we want people to use the store as a meeting place. A place where people can get their
fix of pop culture and hang out for a while. It's not just a place to shop, it's a place to be," said
Christos Garkinos, vice president of marketing for the Virgin Entertainment Group, on the occasion
of the opening of Vancouver's 40,000-square-foot Virgin Mega store.
The building in which Virgin set up shop previously housed the public library, an apt metaphor for
the way brand expansion is altering the way we congregate, not just as shoppers but as citizens.
Barnes & Noble describes its superstores as "a centre for cultural events and gatherings," and some
of these stores, particularly in the United States, do play the part well, housing everything from pop
concerts to poetry readings. Book superstores, with their plush chairs, faux fireplaces, book clubs
and coffee bars, have slowly come to replace libraries and university lecture halls as locales of
choice for author readings on the book-tour circuit. But, as with the ban on protests in malls, a
different set of rules applies in these quasi-public spaces. For example, when promoting his book,
Downsize This!, filmmaker Michael Moore was confronted with a picket line outside a
Philadelphia outlet of Borders bookstore, where he was scheduled to read. He told the store he

wouldn't go in unless the striking employees were allowed inside and given some time at the
microphone. The manager complied, but Moore's future Borders readings were cancelled. "I
couldn't believe I was being censored in a bookstore," Moore wrote of the incident.
As good as the superstores are at dressing up like town halls, no one mimics public space like
America Online, the virtual community of chat rooms, message boards and discussion groups
where there are no customers — only netizens. But AOL subscribers have, in the past two years,
learned some harsh lessons about their virtual community and the limits on the rights of its citizens.
AOL, though part of the publicly owned Internet, is a sort of privatized mini-Net inside the larger
Web. The company collects the toll on the way in and, like mall security guards, it can set the rules
while customers are inside its domain. That was the message that echoed through the virtual
commons when AOUs so-called Community Action Team began deleting messages from
discussion groups deemed harassing, profane, embarrassing or just "unwanted." In addition to
screening messages, the team also has the right to forbid virtual sparring partners from ever trading
messages again and to suspend or expel repeat offenders from the service and from access to their
own E-mail accounts. Some lists —like a particularly heated one on Irish politics — have been shut
down for extended "cooling-off" periods.
The company's rationale is strikingly similar to Wal-Mart's shelving policy (and Blockbuster's
video rental policy). Katherine Boursecnik, AOUs vice president for network programming, told
The New York Times, "We are a service that prides ourselves on having a wide-ranging appeal to a
wide range of individuals. But at the same time we're also a family service." While few contest that
on-line discussion is a breeding ground for all sorts of antisocial behaviour (from chronic
overposting to sexual harassment), the sheer power that the company has to regulate the tone and
content of online discourse has raised the spectre of the "AOL Thought Police." The issue, as with
Wal-Mart, is AOUs commanding market share: in mid-1999 it had 15 million subscribers - 43
percent of the U.S. Internet service market. Its closest competitor, Microsoft, had only 6.4 percent.
Complicating matters further, Internet discussion is a hybrid medium, falling somewhere between
making a personal telephone call and watching cable television. So while its subscribers may view
AOL as a phone company, with no more right to intercept their communications than AT&T has to
disconnect unsavoury phone discussions, the company has another view entirely. "Virtual
community" babble aside, AOL is, above all, a branded media empire over which it exercises as
much control as Disney does over the fence colours in Celebration, Florida.
It seems that no matter how successfully the private sphere emulates or even enhances the look and
feel-of public space, the restrictive tendencies of privatization have a way of peeking through. And
the same applies not only to corporate-owned space, like AOL or Virgin Megastores, but even to
publicly owned space that is sponsored or branded. That point was graphically made in Toronto in
1997 when antitobacco activists were forcibly removed from the open-air du Maurier Downtown
Jazz Festival, just as student protestors had been removed from the du Maurier Tennis Open on
their campus. The irony was that the festival happened to be taking place in the city's actual town
square —Nathan Phillips Square, just in front of Toronto City Hall. The protestors learned that
while the square may be as public a space as one can find, it becomes, during jazz festival week, the
property of the tobacco sponsor. No critical material was permitted on the premises.

When any space is bought, even if only temporarily, it changes to fit its sponsors. And the more
previously public spaces are sold to corporations or branded by them, the more we as citizens are
forced to play by corporate rules to access our own culture. Does this mean that free speech is
dead? Of course not, but it does call to mind Noam Chomsky's view that "freedom without
opportunity is a devil's gift." In a context of media and marketing overload, meaningful
opportunities to express our freedom — at levels loud enough to break through the barrage of
commercial sound effects and disturb the corporate landlords — are disappearing fast around us.
Yes, dissenting voices have their Web pages, zines, posters, picket signs and independent
newspapers, as well as plenty of cracks in the corporate armour to exploit — and as we will see in
Part IV, they are exploiting them as never before. But when corporate speech is increasingly
expressed in multiplatform synergy and in ever more extraordinary displays of branded "meaning,"
popular speech comes to look like the tiny independent retailer next to the superstore. As consumer
advocate Ralph Nader puts it: "There is a decibel-level quality to the exercise of our first
amendment rights." Perhaps the most disturbing manifestation of corporate censorship takes place
when the space that is sold is not a place but a person. As we have seen, the high-stakes
sponsorship agreements in the sports world first exerted their influence by deciding what logo
athletes wore and what teams they played on. Now that control has expanded to what political
views they may hold publicly. Daring political stands like Muhammad Ali's opposition to the
Vietnam War have long since been replaced by the soft-drink radicalism of NBA cross-dresser
Dennis Rodman, as sponsors push their athletes to be little more than billboards with attitude. As
Michael Jordan once commented, "Republicans buy sneakers too."
Canadian sprinter Donovan Bailey learned that lesson the hard way. Days before he won the
Olympic race that would make him the fastest man alive, Bailey came under attack for telling
Sports Illustrated that Canadian society "is as blatantly racist as the United States." Adidas,
horrified that its branded property would risk alienating so many white sneaker buyers with such an
unpopular opinion, rushed in to shut Bailey up. Adidas vice president Doug Hayes told The Globe
and Mail that the comments "have nothing to do with Donovan the athlete or the Donovan we
know"- seemingly attributing the views to a fictional alter-athlete who had possessed Bailey
temporarily.
A similar case of branding censorship involved British soccer star Robbie Fowler. After the twentyone-year-old scored the second goal against the Norwegian team Brann Bergen in March 1997,
Fowler turned to the crowd, pulled up his official jersey, and revealed a red political T-shirt: "500
Liverpool dockers sacked since 1995," the shirt said. The dockers have been on strike for years,
fighting hundreds of layoffs and the shift to contract work. Fowler, a Liverpool boy himself,
decided to publicize the cause when the world was watching. Ingenuously he commented: "I
thought it would be just a simple statement."
He was, of course, mistaken. The Liverpool Football Club, which collects the toll on the branded
messages that appear on the players' official jerseys, raced in to stem any copycat actions. "We will
be pointing out to all our players that comments on matters outside football are not acceptable on
the field of play," the club said in a hastily issued statement. And just to make extra sure that the
only message on the athletes' shirts would be from Umbro or Adidas, the European football
governing body UEFA followed up by slapping Fowler with a fine of 2,000 Swiss francs.

There was yet another twist in this branded tale. The shirt Fowler revealed didn't bear just any
political slogan, it was also an ad bust: in a not-so-subtle subversion of a ubiquitous brand, the
letters "c" and "k" in the word "dockers" had been enlarged and designed to look like Calvin Klein's
logo: doCKers. When photographs of the T-shirt were splashed all over British newspapers, the
designer threatened to sue for trademark violation.
When piled on together, such examples give a picture of corporate space as a fascist state where we
all salute the logo and have little opportunity for criticism because our newspapers, television
stations, Internet servers, streets and retail spaces are all controlled by multinational corporate
interests. And considering the speed with which these trends are developing, we clearly have good
reason for alarm. But a word of caution: we may be able to see a not-so-brave new world on the
horizon, but that doesn't mean we are already living in Huxley's nightmare.
In drawing up octopus-like charts of corporate ownership structures and quoting CEOs on their
dreams of world domination, we may easily lose sight of the fact that censorship is not nearly as
absolute as many a newly converted Noam Chomsky acolyte might like to believe. Instead of an
airtight formula, it is a steady trend, clearly intensified by synergy and the mounting stakes of
brand-name protection, but riddled with exceptions. It's true, for example, that Viacom is coating
the world in bubble gum through its Blockbuster and MTV holdings, but Viacom-owned Simon 8t
Schuster has published some of the best critiques of unregulated economic globalization: Richard J.
Barnet and John Cavanagh's Global Dreams and William Greider's One World, Ready or Not,
among others. NBC and Fox did, however briefly, run Michael Moore's series TV Nation, which
gleefully went after advertisers and even targeted NBC's parent company, General Electric. And
while Disney's purchase of Miramax inspired dark foreboding about the future of independent film,
it was Miramax that distributed Moore's Anticorporate documentary The Big One-a film based on
his similarly critical book, published by Random House, now owned by Bertelsmann. As, I hope,
the book you are holding helps to prove, there is clearly still room for corporate critiques within the
media giants.
In a sense, the shift that is taking place is at once less totalitarian and more dangerous. We haven't
lost the possibility for non-synergistic art, and serious critical work has a greater potential to reach
wide audiences at this time than ever before in the history of art and culture. But we are losing the
spaces in which the noncorporate-minded can flourish — those spaces are there, but they are
shrinking as the captains of the culture industry become more enraptured by the dream of global
cross-promotions. Much of this is a matter of simple economics: there are limited numbers of
movies, books, magazine articles and programming hours that can be economically produced,
published, broadcast, etc., and the window for the ones that don't fit into the reigning corporate
strategy narrows with every merger and consolidation.
There is a chance, however, that the current mania for synergy will collapse under the weight of its
unfulfilled promises. Already, Blockbuster has become a dead weight around Viacom's debt-ridden
neck. The stock-market analysts blame "the quality of products coming through its stores"— and it
probably doesn't help that the chain has had to devote entire wings of its stores to showcasing some
thirty-four copies of Kevin Kline's unwatchable In & Out (or some other Paramount flop) because
the folks at Viacom were determined to make back some of the millions they lost in theatres. And
after its "eatertainment" outlets haemorrhaged money for two years, Planet Hollywood announced
in August 1999 that it would file for bankruptcy protection. Another synergy scheme that looked

foolproof on paper was the 1998 release of Godzilla. Sony thought it had its blockbuster status
sewn up: it had a Madison Square Garden premiere, a made-for-Toys 'R' Us star, a $60 million
marketing budget orchestrating a year-long "teaser" campaign, and a heavy-handed legal team
cracking down on all unwanted publicity on the Internet. Most important, thanks to Sony's newly
consolidated movie theatre holdings, the movie played on more screens than any film ever before:
on launch day, 20 percent of all U.S. movie theatre screens were playing Godzilla. Yet none of this
could compensate for the simple fact that nearly everyone who saw Godzilla warned their friends to
stay away, and they did, in droves.
Even branding evangelist Tom Peters acknowledges that there is such a thing as too much brand,
and impossible though it is to predict when we will reach that point, when we pass it, it will be
unmistakable. "How much is enough?" asks Peters. "Nobody knows for sure. It's pure art. Leverage
is good. Too much leverage is bad." MTV founder Tom Freston, the man who made marketing
history by turning a television station into a brand, admitted in June 1998 that "you can beat a brand
to death."
Indeed, by early 1998, Wall Street was declaring the unthinkable: Nike had outswooshed itself; its
ubiquity had ceased to be a branding success story and had become a liability. "Mike's biggest
challenge is itself. They need to come up with another identity that they can still say, This is Nike,'
but it's something beyond the swoosh," Josie Esquivel, a stock analyst with Morgan Stanley told
The New York Times.
Nike has attempted to respond to this challenge, as we shall see. But if such a backlash is possible
against a single brand, then perhaps it's conceivable that a similar phenomenon can apply equally to
the act of branding as a whole: that after a certain amount of branding mania is stamped on a
culture, those of us who have been branded —by Nike, Wal-Mart, Hilfiger, Microsoft, Disney,
Starbucks, et al. -will begin to turn not just against these specific logos, but also against the control
that corporate power as a whole exerts over our spaces and choices. Maybe there is a moment when
the idea of branding reaches a saturation point and the backlash is directed not at a product that
suddenly finds itself on the wrong side of a fad but at the multinationals behind the brands.
There is some evidence that this process is already under way. As we will see in Part IV, "No
Logo," communities around the world, and at various generational levels, are no longer being
blinded by the brands' shiny promises of newness and of endless selection. Instead of swinging
open their doors, they are organizing at community levels to block the arrival of big-box retailers;
they are participating in street-level campaigns against Nike's Third World labour practices and
Shell Oil's human-rights record. They are launching movements, like Britain's Reclaim the Streets,
to regain some fleeting public control over public space; and they are supporting anti-trust actions
against companies such as Microsoft. Given the relative suddenness of the backlash, this wave of
Anticorporate hostility is understandably taking its targets by surprise. "A few months ago,
everyone I met seemed to think that working for Microsoft was a pretty cool thing to do. Now,
strangers treat us like we work for Philip Morris," wrote Slate columnist Jacob Weisberg. The
bewildered sentiment is shared by multinational employees across many sectors. "I don't know how
we are offending people," said Starbucks regional marketing director Donna Peterson in May 1999.
"But sometimes it seems we are." And Royal Dutch/Shell head Mark Moody-Stuart told Fortune
magazine, "Previously, if you went to your golf club or church and said, 'I work for Shell,' you'd get

a warm glow. In some parts of the world that changed a bit." And (as we will see in the
examination of the Shell boycott in Chapter 16), that in itself is a bit of an understatement.
Mounting disillusionment in the face of the forces described here in "No Space" and "No Choice" is
not, however, sufficiently widespread or deep to spark a genuine backlash against the power of the
brands. In all likelihood, resentment at invasive advertising, the corporate takeover of public space,
and monopolistic business practices would have festered as little more than run-of-the-mill
cynicism had many of the same companies gobbling up both space and choice not decided
simultaneously to bankroll their innovative branding forays by slashing jobs. It is this essential
economic, human concern that has been a major force in contributing to the rise in Anticorporate
activism: No Good Jobs.

THE DISCARDED FACTORY

Our strategic plan in North America is to focus intensely on brand management, marketing and
product design as a means to meet the casual clothing wants and needs of consumers. Shifting a
significant portion of our manufacturing from the U.S. and Canadian markets to contractors
throughout the world will give the company greater flexibility to allocate resources and capital to
its brands. These steps are crucial if we are to remain competitive.
-John Ermatinger, president of Levi Strauss Americas division, explains the company's decision to
shut down twenty-two plants and lay off 13,000 North American workers between
November 1997 and February 1999

Many brand-name multinationals, as we have seen, are in the process of transcending the need to
identify with their earthbound products. They dream instead about their brands' deep inner
meanings — the way they capture the spirit of individuality, athleticism, wilderness or community.
In this context of strut over stuff, marketing departments charged with the managing of brand
identities have begun to see their work as something that occurs not in conjunction with factory
production but in direct competition with it. "Products are made in the factory," says Walter
Landor, president of the Landor branding agency, "but brands are made in the mind."' Peter
Schweitzer, president of the advertising giant J. Walter Thompson, reiterates the same thought:
"The difference between products and brands is fundamental. A product is something that is made
in a factory; a brand is something that is bought by a customer." Savvy ad agencies have all moved
away from the idea that they are flogging a product made by someone else, and have come to think
of themselves instead as brand factories, hammering out what is of true value: the idea, the lifestyle,
the attitude. Brand builders are the new primary producers in our so-called knowledge economy.
This novel idea has done more than bring us cutting-edge ad campaigns, ecclesiastic superstores
and Utopian corporate campuses. It is changing the very face of global employment. After
establishing the "soul" of their corporations, the superbrand companies have gone on to rid
themselves of their cumbersome bodies, and there is nothing that seems more cumbersome, more
loathsomely corporeal, than the factories that produce their products. The reason for this shift is
simple: building a superbrand is an extraordinarily costly project, needing constant managing,
tending and replenishing. Most of all, superbrands need lots of space on which to stamp their logos.
For a business to be cost-effective, however, there is a finite amount of money it can spend on all of
its expenses —materials, manufacturing, overhead and branding — before retail prices on its
products shoot up too high. After the multimillion-dollar sponsorships have been signed, and the
cool hunters and marketing mavens have received their checks, there may not be all that much
money left over. So it becomes, as always, a matter of priorities; but those priorities are changing.

As Hector Liang, former chairman of United Biscuits, has explained: "Machines wear out. Cars
rust. People die. But what lives on are the brands."
According to this logic, corporations should not expend their finite resources on factories that will
demand physical upkeep, on machines that will corrode or on employees who will certainly age and
die. Instead, they should concentrate those resources in the virtual brick and mortar used to build
their brands; that is, on sponsorships, packaging, expansion and advertising. They should also
spend them on synergies: on buying up distribution and retail channels to get their brands to the
people.
This slow but decisive shift in corporate priorities has left yesterday's nonvirtual producers — the
factory workers and craftspeople — in a precarious position. The lavish spending in the 1990s on
marketing, mergers and brand extensions has been matched by a never-before-seen resistance to
investing in production facilities and labour. Companies that were traditionally satisfied with a 100
percent mark-up between the cost of factory production and the retail price have been scouring the
globe for factories that can make their products so inexpensively that the mark-up is closer to 400
percent. And as a 1997 UN report notes, even in countries where wages were already low, labour
costs are getting a shrinking slice of corporate budgets. "In four developing countries out of five,
the share of wages in manufacturing value-added today is considerably below what it was in the
1970s and early 1980s." The timing of these trends reflects not only branding's status as the
perceived economic cure-all, but also a corresponding devaluation of the production process and of
producers in general. Branding, in other words, has been hogging all the "value-added."
When the actual manufacturing process is so devalued, it stands to reason that the people doing the
work of production are likely to be treated like detritus — the stuff left behind. The idea has a
certain symmetry: ever since mass production created the need for branding in the first place, its
role has slowly been expanding in importance until, more than a century and a half after the
Industrial Revolution, it occurred to these companies that maybe branding could replace production
entirely. As tennis pro Andre Agassi said in a 1992 Canon camera commercial, "Image is
everything."
Agassi may have been pitching for Canon at the time but he is first and foremost a member of
Team Nike, the company that pioneered the business philosophy of no-limits spending on branding,
coupled with a near-total divestment of the contract workers that make its shoes in tucked-away
factories. As Phil Knight has said, "There is no value in making things any more. The value is
added by careful research, by innovation and by marketing." For Phil Knight, production is not the
building block of his branded empire, but is instead a tedious, marginal chore.
Which is why many companies now bypass production completely. Instead of making the products
themselves, in their own factories, they "source" them, much as corporations in the natural-resource
industries source uranium, copper or logs. They close existing factories, shifting to contracted-out,
mostly offshore, manufacturing. And as the old jobs fly offshore, something else is flying away
with them: the old-fashioned idea that a manufacturer is responsible for its own workforce. Disney
spokesman Ken Green gave an indication of the depth of this shift when he became publicly
frustrated that his company was being taken to task for the desperate conditions in a Haitian factory
that produces Disney clothes. "We don't employ anyone in Haiti," he said, referring to the fact that
the factory is owned by a contractor. "With the newsprint you use, do you have any idea of the

labour conditions involved to produce it?" Green demanded of Cathy Majtenyi of the Catholic
Register.
From El Paso to Beijing, San Francisco to Jakarta, Munich to Tijuana, the global brands are
sloughing the responsibility of production onto their contractors; they just tell them to make the
damn thing, and make it cheap, so there's lots of money left over for branding. Make it really cheap.

a¬hXg	edcZg$^_\°	-_a­ýXk_}
Nike, which began as an import/export scheme of made-in-Japan running shoes and does not own
any of its factories, has become a prototype for the product-tree brand. Inspired by the swoosh's
staggering success, many more traditionally run companies ("vertically integrated," as the phrase
goes) are busy imitating Nike's model, not only copying the company's marketing approach, as we
saw in "No Space," but also its on-the-cheap outsourced production structure. In the mid-nineties,
for instance, the Vans running-shoe company pulled up stakes in the old-fashioned realm of
manufacturing and converted to the Nike way. In a prospectus for an initial public stock offering,
the company lays out how it "recently repositioned itself from a domestic manufacturer to a marketdriven company" by sponsoring hundreds of athletes as well as high-profile extreme sporting events
such as the Vans Warped Tour. The company's "expenditure of significant funds to create consumer
demand" was financed by closing an existing factory in California and contracting production in
South Korea to "third party manufacturers."
Adidas followed a similar trajectory, turning over its operation in 1993 to Robert Louis-Dreyfus,
formerly a chief executive at advertising giant Saatchi & Saatchi. Announcing that he wanted to
capture the heart of the "global teenager," Louis-Dreyfus promptly shut down the company-owned
factories in Germany, and moved to contracting-out in Asia. Freed from the chains of production,
the company had newfound time and money to create a Nike-style brand image. "We closed down
everything," Adidas spokesperson Peter Csanadi says proudly. "We only kept one small factory
which is our global technology centre and makes about 1 percent of total output."
Though they don't draw the headlines they once did, more factory closures are announced in North
America and Europe each week —45,000 U.S. apparel workers lost their jobs in 1997 alone.) That
sector's job-flight patterns have been equally dramatic around the globe. Though plant closures
themselves have barely slowed down since the darkest days of the late-eighties/early-nineties
recession, there has been a marked shift in the reason given for these "reorganizations." Mass
layoffs were previously presented as an unfortunate necessity, tied to disappointing company
performance. Today they are simply savvy shifts in corporate strategy, a "strategic redirection," to
use the Vans term. More and more, these layoffs are announced in conjunction with pledges to
increase revenue through advertising spending, with executives vowing to refocus on the needs of
their brands, as opposed to the needs of their workers.
Consider the case of Sara Lee Corp., an old-style conglomerate that encompasses not only its
frozen-food namesake but also such "unintegrated" brands as Hanes underwear, Wonderbra, Coach
leather goods, Champion sports apparel, Kiwi shoe polish and Ball Park Franks. Despite the fact
that Sara Lee enjoyed solid growth, healthy profits, good stock return and no debt, by the midnineties Wall Street had become disenchanted with the company and was undervaluing its stock. Its

profits had risen 10 percent in the 1996-97 fiscal year, hitting $1 billion, but Wall Street, as we
have seen, is guided by spiritual goals as well as economic ones. And Sara Lee, driven by the
corporeal stuff of real-world products, as opposed to the sleek ideas of brand identity, was simply
out of economic fashion. "Lumpy-object purveyors," as Tom Peters might say.
To correct the situation, in September 1997 the company announced a $1.6 billion restructuring
plan to get out of the "stuff" business by purging its manufacturing base. Thirteen of its factories,
beginning with yarn and textile plants, would be sold to contractors who would become Sara Lee's
suppliers. The company would be able to dip into the money saved to double its ad spending. "It's
passé for us to be as vertically integrated as we were," explained Sara Lee CEO John H. Bryan.
Wall Street and the business press loved the new marketing-driven Sara Lee, rewarding the
company with a 15 percent jump in stock price and flattering profiles of its bold and imaginative
CEO. "Bryan's shift away from manufacturing to focus on brand marketing recognizes that the
future belongs to companies — like Coca-Cola Co. — that own little but sell much," enthused one
article in Business Week. Even more telling was the analogy chosen by Grain's Chicago Business:
"Sara Lee's goal is to become more like Oregon-based Nike Inc., which out-sources its
manufacturing and focuses primarily on product development and brand management."
In November 1997, Levi Strauss announced a similarly motivated shake-up. Company revenue had
dropped between 1996 and 1997, from $7.1 billion to $6.8 billion. But a 4 percent dip hardly seems
to explain the company's decision to shut eleven plants. The closures resulted in 6,395 workers
being laid off, one-third of its already downsized North American workforce. In this process, the
company shut down three of its four factories in El Paso, Texas, a city where Levi's was the single
largest private employer. Still unsatisfied with the results, the following year Levi's announced
another round of closures in Europe and North America. Eleven more of its North American
factories would be shut down and the total toll of laid-off workers rose to 16,310 in only two years.
John Ermatinger, president of Levi's Americas division, had a familiar explanation. "Our strategic
plan in North America is to focus intensely on brand management, marketing and product design as
a means to meet the casual clothing wants and needs of consumers," he said. Levi's chairman,
Robert Haas, who on the same day received an award from the UN for making life better for his
employees, told The Wall Street Journal that the closures reflected not just "overcapacity" but also
"our own desire to refocus marketing, to inject more quality and distinctiveness into the brand." In
1997, this quality and distinctiveness came in the form of a particularly funky international ad
campaign rumoured to have cost $90 million, Levi's most expensive campaign ever, and more than
the company spent advertising the brand in all of 1996.

In explaining the plant closures as a decision to turn Levi's into "a marketing company," Robert
Haas was careful to tell the press that the jobs that were eliminated were not "leaving," they were
just sort of evaporating. "This is not a job-flight story," he said after the first round of layoffs. The
statement is technically true. Seeing Levi's as a job-flight story would miss the more fundamental
— and more damaging — shift that the closures represent. As far as the company is concerned,
those 16,310 jobs are off the payrolls for good, replaced, according to Ermatinger, by "contractors

throughout the world." Those contractors will perform the same tasks as the old Levi's-owned
factories —but the workers inside will never be employed by Levi Strauss.
For some companies a plant closure is still a straightforward decision to move the same facility to a
cheaper locale. But for others — particularly those with strong brand identities like Levi Strauss
and Hanes —layoffs are only the most visible manifestation of a much more fundamental shift: one
that is less about where to produce than how. Unlike factories that hop from one place to another,
these factories will never rematerialize. Mid-flight, they morph into something else entirely:
"orders" to be placed with a contractor, who may well turn over those orders to as many as ten
subcontractors, who —particularly in the garment sector — may in turn pass a portion of the
subcontracts on to a network of home workers who will complete the jobs in basements and living
rooms. Sure enough, only five months after the first round of plant closures was announced, Levi's
made another public statement: it would resume manufacturing in China. The company had pulled
out of China in 1993, citing concerns about human-rights violations. Now it has returned, not to
build its own factories, but to place orders with three contractors that the company vows to closely
monitor for violations of labour law.
This shift in attitude toward production is so profound that where a previous era of consumer goods
corporations displayed their logos on the facades of their factories, many of today's brand-based
multinationals now maintain that the location of their production operations is a "trade secret," to be
guarded at all costs. When asked by human-rights groups in April 1999 to disclose the names and
addresses of its contract factories, Peggy Carter, a vice president at Champion clothing, replied:
"We have no interest in our competition learning where we are located and taking advantage of
what has taken us years to build."
Increasingly, brand-name multinationals -Levi's, Nike, Champion, Wal-Mart, Reebok, the Gap,
IBM and General Motors-insist that they are just like any one of us: bargain hunters in search of the
best deal in the global mall. They are very picky customers, with specific instructions about madeto-order design, materials, delivery dates and, most important, the need for rock-bottom prices. But
what they are not interested in is the burdensome logistics of how those prices fall so low; building
factories, buying machinery and budgeting for labour have all been lobbed squarely into somebody
else's court.
And the real job-flight story is that a growing number of the most high-profile and profitable
corporations in the world are fleeing the jobs business altogether.

Despite the conceptual brilliance of the "brands, not products" strategy, production has a pesky way
of never quite being transcended entirely: somebody has to get down and dirty and make the
products the global brands will hang their meaning on. And that's where the free-trade zones come
in. In Indonesia, China, Mexico, Vietnam, the Philippines and elsewhere, export processing zones
(as these areas are also called) are emerging as leading producers of garments, toys, shoes,
electronics, machinery, even cars.
If Nike Town and the other superstores are the glittering new gateways to the branded
dreamworlds, then the Cavite Export Processing Zone, located ninety miles south of Manila in the

town of Rosario, is the branding broom closet. After a month visiting similar industrial areas in
Indonesia, I arrived in Rosario in early September 1997, at the tail end of monsoon season and the
beginning of the Asian economic storm. I'd come to spend a week in Cavite because it is the largest
free-trade zone in the Philippines, a 682-acre walled-in industrial area housing 207 factories that
produce goods strictly for the export market. Rosario's population of 60,000 all seemed to be on the
move; the town's busy, sweltering streets were packed with army jeeps converted into minibuses
and with motorcycle taxis with precarious sidecars, its sidewalks lined with stalls selling fried rice,
Coke and soap. Most of this commercial activity serves the 50,000 workers who rush through
Rosario on their way to and from work in the zone, whose gated entrance is located smack in the
middle of town.
Inside the gates, factory workers assemble the finished products of our branded world: Nike
running shoes, Gap pajamas, IBM computer screens, Old Navy jeans. But despite the presence of
such illustrious multinationals, Cavite
- and the exploding number of export processing zones like it throughout the developing world —
could well be the only places left on earth where the superbrands actually keep a low profile.
Indeed, they are positively self-effacing. Their names and logos aren't splashed on the facades of
the factories in the industrial zone. And here, competing labels aren't segregated each in its own
superstore; they are often produced side by side in the same factories, glued by the very same
workers, stitched and soldered on the very same machines. It was in Cavite that I finally found a
piece of unswooshed space, and I found it, oddly enough, in a Nike shoe factory. I was only
permitted one visit inside the zone's gates to interview officials
-individual factories, I was told, are off limits to anyone but potential importers or exporters. But a
few days later, with the help of an eighteen-year-old worker who had been laid off from his job in
an electronics factory, I managed to sneak back to get the unofficial tour. In the rows of virtually
identical giant shed-like structures, one factory stood out: the name on the white rectangular
building said "Philips," but through its surrounding fence I could see mountains of Nike shoes piled
high. It seems that in Cavite, production has been banished to our age's most worthless status: its
factories are unbrandable, unswooshworthy; producers are the industrial untouchables. Is this what
Phil Knight meant, I wondered, when he said his company wasn't about the sneakers?
Manufacturing is concentrated and isolated inside the zone as if it were toxic waste: pure, 100
percent production at low, low prices. Cavite, like the rest of the zones that compete with it,
presents itself as the buy-in-bulk Price Club for multinationals on the lookout for bargains - grab a
really big shopping cart. Inside, it's obvious that the row of factories, each with its own gate and
guard, has been carefully planned to squeeze the maximum amount of production out of this swath
of land. Windowless workshops made of cheap plastic and aluminium siding are crammed in next
to each other, only feet apart. Racks of time cards bake in the sun, making sure the maximum
amount of work is extracted from each worker, the maximum number of working hours extracted
from each day. The streets in the zone are eerily empty, and open doors-the ventilation system for
most factories — reveal lines of young women hunched in silence over clamouring machines.
In other parts of the world, workers live inside the economic zones, but not in Cavite: this is a place
of pure work. All the bustle and colour of Rosario abruptly stops at the gates, where workers must
show their ID cards to armed guards in order to get inside. Visitors are rarely permitted in the zone

and little or no internal commerce takes place on its orderly streets, not even candy and drink
vending. Buses and taxicabs must drop their speed and silence their horns when they get into the
zone — a marked change from the boisterous streets of Rosario. If all of this makes Cavite feel as if
it's in a different country, that's because, in a way, it is. The zone is a tax-free economy, sealed off
from the local government of both town and province — a miniature military state inside a
democracy.
As a concept, free-trade zones are as old as commerce itself, and were all the more relevant in
ancient times when the transportation of goods required multiple holdovers and rest stops. PreRoman Empire city-states, including Tyre, Carthage and Utica, encouraged trade by declaring
themselves "free cities," where goods in transit could be stored without tax, and merchants would
be protected from harm. These tax-free areas developed further economic significance during
colonial times, when entire cities — including Hong Kong, Singapore and Gibraltar — were
designated as "free ports" from which the loot of colonialism could be safely shipped back to
England, Europe or America with low import tariffs. Today, the globe is dotted with variations on
these tax-free pockets, from duty-free shops in airports and the free banking zones of the Cayman
Islands to bonded warehouses and ports where goods in transit are held, sorted and packaged.
Though it has plenty in common with these other tax havens, the export processing zone is really in
a class of its own. Less holding tank than sovereign territory, the EPZ is an area where goods don't
just pass through but are actually manufactured, an area, furthermore, where there are no import and
export duties, and often no income or property taxes either. The idea that EPZs could help Third
World economies first gained currency in 1964 when the United Nations Economic and Social
Council adopted a resolution endorsing the zones as a means of promoting trade with developing
nations. The idea didn't really get off the ground, however, until the early eighties, when India
introduced a five-year tax break for companies manufacturing in its low-wage zones.
Since then, the free-trade-zone industry has exploded. There are fifty-two economic zones in the
Philippines alone, employing 459,000 people - that's up from only 23,000 zone workers in 1986
and 229,000 as recently as 1994. The largest zone economy is China, where by conservative
estimates there are 18 million people in 124 export processing zones. In total, the International
Labour Organization says that there are at least 850 EPZs in the world, but that number is likely
much closer to 1,000, spread through seventy countries and employing roughly 27 million workers.
The World Trade Organization estimates that between $200 and $250 billion worth of trade flows
through the zones. The number of individual factories housed inside these industrial parks is also
expanding. In fact, the free-trade factories along the U.S.Mexico border —in Spanish, maquiladoras
(from maquillar, "to make up, or assemble") - are probably the only structures that proliferate as
quickly as Wal-Mart outlets: there were 789 maquiladoras in 1985. In 1995, there were 2,747. By
1997, there were 3,508 employing about 900,000 workers.
Regardless of where the EPZs are located, the workers' stories have a certain mesmerizing
sameness: the workday is long —fourteen hours in Sri Lanka, twelve hours in Indonesia, sixteen in
Southern China, twelve in the Philippines. The vast majority of the workers are women, always
young, always working for contractors or subcontractors from Korea, Taiwan or Hong Kong. The
contractors are usually filling orders for companies based in the U.S., Britain, Japan, Germany or
Canada. The management is military-style, the supervisors often abusive, the wages below
subsistence and the work low-skill and tedious. As an economic model, today's export processing

zones have more in common with fast-food franchises than sustainable developments, so removed
are they from the countries that host them. These pockets of pure industry hide behind a cloak of
transience: the contracts come and go with little notice; the workers are predominantly migrants, far
from home and with little connection to the city or province where zones are located; the work
itself is short-term, often not renewed.
As I walk along the blank streets of Cavite, I can feel the threatening impermanence, the underlying
instability of the zone. The shed-like factories are connected so tenuously to the surrounding
country, to the adjacent town, to the very earth they are perched upon, that it feels as if the jobs that
flew here from the North could fly away again just as quickly. The factories are cheaply constructed
and tossed together on land that is rented, not owned. When I climb up the water tower on the edge
of the zone and look down at the hundreds of factories, it seems as if the whole cardboard complex
could lift up and blow away, like Dorothy's house in The Wizard of Oz. No wonder the EPZ
factories in Guatemala are called "swallows."
Fear pervades the zones. The governments are afraid of losing their foreign factories; the factories
are afraid of losing their brand-name buyers; and the workers are afraid of losing their unstable
jobs. These are factories built not on land but on air.

The air the export processing zones are built upon is the promise of industrialization. The theory
behind EPZs is that they will attract foreign investors, who, if all goes well, will decide to stay in
the country, and the zones' segregated assembly lines will turn into lasting development:
technology transfers and domestic industries. To lure the swallows into this clever trap, the
governments of poor countries offer tax breaks, lax regulations and the services of a military
willing and able to crush labour unrest. To sweeten the pot further, they put their own people on the
auction block, falling over each other to offer up the lowest minimum wage, allowing workers to be
paid less than the real cost of living.
In Cavite, the economic zone is designed as a fantasyland for foreign investors. Golf courses,
executive clubs and private schools have been built on the outskirts of Rosario to ease the
discomforts of Third World life. Rent for factories is dirt cheap: 11 pesos per square foot — less
than a cent. For the first five years of their stay, corporations are treated to an all-expenses-paid "tax
holiday" during which they pay no income tax and no property tax. It's a good deal, no doubt, but
it's nothing compared to Sri Lanka, where EPZ investors stay for ten years before having to pay any
tax.
The phrase "tax holiday" is oddly fitting. For the investors, free-trade zones are a sort of corporate
Club Med, where the hotel pays for everything and the guests live free, and where integration with
the local culture and economy is kept to a bare minimum. As one International Labour Organization
report puts it, the EPZ "is to the inexperienced foreign investor what the package holiday is to the
cautious tourist." Zero-risk globalization. Companies just ship in the pieces of cloth or computer
parts — free of import tax - and the cheap, non-union workforce assembles it for them. Then the
finished garments or electronics are shipped back out, with no export tax.

The rationale goes something like this: of course companies must pay taxes and strictly abide by
national laws, but just in this one case, on this one specific piece of land, for just a little while, an
exception will be made — for the cause of future prosperity. The EPZs, therefore, exist within a
kind of legal and economic set of brackets, apart from the rest of their countries — the Cavite zone,
for example, is under the sole jurisdiction of the Philippines' federal Department of Trade and
Industry; the local police and municipal government have no right even to cross the threshold. The
layers of blockades serve a dual purpose: to keep the hordes away from the costly goods being
manufactured inside the zone, but also, and perhaps more important, to shield the country from
what is going on inside the zone.
Because such sweet deals have been laid out to entice the swallows, the barriers around the zone
serve to reinforce the idea that what is happening inside is only temporary, or is not really
happening at all. This collective denial is particularly important in Communist countries where
zones house the most Wild West forms of capitalism this side of Moscow: this is definitely not
really happening, certainly not here where the government in power maintains that capital is the
devil and workers reign supreme. In her book Losing Control?, Saskia Sassen writes that the zones
are a part of a process of carving up nations so that "an actual piece of land becomes
denationalized...." Never mind that the boundaries of these only-temporary, not-really-happening,
denationalized spaces keep expanding to engulf more and more of their actual nations. Twentyseven million people worldwide are now living and working in brackets, and the brackets, instead
of being slowly removed, just keep getting wider.
It is one of the zones' many cruel ironies that every incentive the governments throw in to attract the
multinationals only reinforces the sense that the companies are economic tourists rather than longterm investors. It's a classic vicious cycle: in an attempt to alleviate poverty, the governments offer
more and more incentives; but then the EPZs must be cordoned off like leper colonies, and the
more they are cordoned off, the more the factories appear to exist in a world entirely separate from
the host country, and outside the zone the poverty only grows more desperate. In Cavite, the zone is
a kind of futuristic industrial suburbia where everything is ordered; the workers are uniformed, the
grass manicured, the factories regimented. There are cute signs all around the grounds instructing
workers to "Keep Our Zone Clean" and "Promote Peace and Progress of the Philippines." But walk
out of the gate and the bubble bursts. Aside from the swarms of workers at the start and end of
shifts, you'd never know that the town of Rosario is home to more than two hundred factories. The
roads are a mess, running water is scarce and garbage is overflowing.
Many of the workers live in shantytowns on the outskirts of town and in neighbouring villages.
Others, particularly the youngest workers, live in the dormitories, a hodgepodge of concrete
bunkers separated from the zone enclave by only a thick wall. The structure is actually a converted
farm, and some rooms, the workers tell me, are really pigpens with roofs slapped on them.
The Philippines' experience of "industrialization in brackets" is by no means unique. The current
mania for the EPZ model is based on the successes of the so-called Asian Tiger economies, in
particular the economies of South Korea and Taiwan. When only a few countries had the zones,
including South Korea and Taiwan, wages rose steadily, technology transfers occurred and taxes
were gradually introduced. But as critics of EPZs are quick to point out, the global economy has
become much more competitive since those countries made the transition from low-wage industries
to higher-skill ones. Today, with seventy countries competing for the export-processing-zone

dollar, the incentives to lure investors are increasing and the wages and standards are being held
hostage to the threat of departure. The upshot is that entire countries are being turned into industrial
slums and low-wage labour ghettos, with no end in sight. As Cuban president Fidel Castro
thundered to the assembled world leaders at the World Trade Organization's fiftieth-birthday
celebration in May 1998, "What are we going to live on?... What industrial production will be left
for us? Only low-tech, labour-intensive and highly contaminating ones? Do they perhaps want to
turn a large part of the Third World into a huge free trade zone full of assembly plants which don't
even pay taxes?"
As bad as the situation is in Cavite, it doesn't begin to compare with Sri Lanka, where extended tax
holidays mean that towns can't even provide public transportation for EPZ workers. The roads they
walk to and from the factories are dark and dangerous, since there is no money for streetlights.
Dormitory rooms are so overcrowded that they have white lines painted on the floor to mark where
each worker sleeps — they "look like car parks," as one journalist observed.
Jose Ricafrente has the dubious honour of being mayor of Rosario. I met with him in his small
office, while a line-up of needy people waited outside. A once-modest fishing village, his town
today has the highest per capita investment in all of the Philippines — thanks to the Cavite zone —
but it lacks even the basic resources to clean up the mess that the factories create in the community.
Rosario has all the problems of industrialization —pollution, an exploding population of migrant
workers, increased crime, rivers of sewage — without any of the benefits. The federal government
estimates that only 30 of the zone's 207 factories pay any taxes at all, but everybody else questions
even that low figure. The mayor says that many companies are granted extensions of their tax
holiday, or they close and reopen under another name, then take the free ride all over again. "They
fold up before the tax holiday expires, then they incorporate to another company, just to avoid
payment of taxes. They don't pay anything to the government, so we're in a dilemma right now,"
Ricafrente told me. A small man with a deep and powerful voice, Ricafrente is loved by his
constituents for the outspoken positions he took on human rights and democracy during Ferdinand
Marcos's brutal rule. But the day I met him, the mayor seemed exhausted, worn down by his
powerless-ness to affect the situation in his own backyard. "We cannot even provide the basic
services that our people expect from us," he said, with a sort of matter-of-fact rage. "We need
water, we need roads, we need medical services, education. They expect us to deliver all of them at
the same time, expecting that we've got money from taxes from the places inside the zone." The
mayor is convinced that there will always be a country — whether Vietnam, China, Sri Lanka or
Mexico — that is willing to bid lower. And in the process, towns like Rosario will have sold out
their people, compromised their education system and polluted their natural resources. "It should be
a symbiotic relationship," Ricafrente says of foreign investment. "They derive income from us, so
the government should also derive income from them.... It should have been a different Rosario."

So, if it's clear by now that the factories don't bring in taxes or create local infrastructures, and that
the goods produced are all exported, why do countries like the Philippines still bend over backward
to lure them inside their borders? The official reason is a trickle-down theory: these zones are jobcreation programs and the income the workers earn will eventually fuel sustainable growth in the
local economy.

The problem with this theory is that the zone wages are so low that workers spend most of their pay
on shared dorm rooms and transportation; the rest goes to noodles and fried rice from vendors lined
up outside the gate. Zone workers certainly cannot dream of affording the consumer goods they
produce. These low wages are partly a result of the fierce competition for factories coming from
other developing countries. But, above all, the government is extremely reluctant to enforce its own
labour laws for fear of scaring away the swallows. So labour rights are under such severe assault
inside the zones that there is little chance of workers earning enough to adequately feed themselves,
let alone stimulate the local economy.
The Philippine government denies this, of course. It says that the zones are subject to the same
labour standards as the rest of Philippine society: workers must be paid the minimum wage, receive
social security benefits, have some measure of job security, be dismissed only with just cause and
be paid extra for overtime, and they have the right to form independent trade unions. But in reality,
the government views working conditions in the export factories as a matter of foreign trade policy,
not a labour-rights issue. And since the government attracted the foreign investors with promises of
a cheap and docile workforce, it intends to deliver. For this reason, labour department officials turn
a blind eye to violations in the zone or even facilitate them.
Many of the zone factories are run according to iron-fist rules that systematically break Philippine
labour law. Some employers, for instance, keep bathrooms padlocked except during two fifteenminute breaks, during which time all the workers have to sign in and out so management can keep
track of their non-productive time. Seamstresses at a factory sewing garments for the Gap, Guess
and Old Navy told me that they sometimes have to resort to urinating in plastic bags under their
machines. There are rules against talking, and at the Ju Young electronics factory, a rule against
smiling. One factory shames those who disobey by posting a list of "The Most Talkative Workers."
Factories regularly cheat on their workers' social security payments and gather illegal "donations"
from workers for everything from cleaning materials to factory Christmas parties. At a factory that
makes IBM computer screens, the "bonus" for working hours of overtime isn't a higher hourly wage
but doughnuts and a pen. Some owners expect workers to pull weeds from the ground on their way
into the factory; others must clean the floors and the washrooms after their shifts end. Ventilation is
poor and protective gear scarce.
Then there is the matter of wages. In the Cavite zone, the minimum wage is regarded more as a
loose guideline than as a rigid law. If $6 a day is too onerous, investors can apply to the
government for a waiver on that too. So while some zone workers earn the minimum wage, most —
thanks to the waivers - earn less.

Part of the reason the threat of factory flight is so tangible in Cavite is that compared with China,
Filipino wages are very high. In fact, everyone's wages are high compared with China. But what is
truly remarkable about that is that the most egregious wage cheating goes on inside China itself.
Labour groups agree that a living wage for an assembly-line worker in China would be
approximately US87 cents an hour. In the United States and Germany, where multinationals have

closed down hundreds of domestic textile factories to move to zone production, garment workers
are paid an average of US$10 and $18.50 an hour, respectively. Yet even with these massive
savings in labour costs, those who manufacture for the most prominent and richest brands in the
world are still refusing to pay workers in China the 87 cents that would cover their cost of living,
stave off illness and even allow them to send a little money home to their families. A 1998 study of
brand-name manufacturing in the Chinese special economic zones found that Wal-Mart, Ralph
Lauren, Ann Taylor, Esprit, Liz Claiborne, Kmart, Nike, Adidas, J.C. Penney and the Limited were
only paying a fraction of that miserable 87 cents-some were paying as little as 13 cents an hour.
The only way to understand how rich and supposedly law-abiding multinational corporations could
regress to nineteenth-century levels of exploitation (and get caught repeatedly) is through the
mechanics of subcontracting itself: at every layer of contracting, subcontracting and homework, the
manufacturers bid against each other to drive down the price, and at every level the contractor and
subcontractor exact their small profit. At the end of this bid-down, contract-out chain is the workeroften three or four times removed from the company that placed the original order-with a pay check
that has been trimmed at every turn. "When the multinationals squeeze the subcontractors, the
subcontractors squeeze the workers," explains a 1997 report on Nike's and Reebok's Chinese shoe
factories.

A large sign is posted at a central intersection in the Cavite Export Processing Zone: "DO NOT
LISTEN TO AGITATORS AND TROUBLE MAKERS." The words are in English, painted in
bright red capital letters and everyone knows what they mean. Although trade unions are
technically legal in the Philippines, there is a widely understood - if unwritten - "no union, no
strike" policy inside the zones. As the sign suggests, workers who do attempt to organize unions in
their factories are viewed as troublemakers, and often face threats and intimidation.
One of the reasons I went to Cavite is that I had heard this zone was a hotbed of "troublemaking,"
thanks to a newly formed organization called the Workers' Assistance Centre. Attached to Rosario's
Catholic church only a few blocks from the zone's entrance, the centre is trying to break through the
wall of fear that surrounds free-trade zones in the Philippines. Slowly, they have been collecting
information about working conditions inside the zone. Nida Barcenas, one of the organizers at the
centre, told me, "At first, I used to have to follow workers home and beg them to talk to me. They
were so scared - their families said I was a troublemaker." But after the centre had been up and
running for a year, the zone workers flocked there after their shifts — to hang out, eat dinner and
attend seminars. I had heard about the centre back in Toronto, told by several international labour
experts that the research and organizing on free-trade zones coming out of this little bare-bones
operation is among the most advanced being done anywhere in Asia.
The Workers' Assistance Centre, known as WAC, was founded to support the factory workers'
constitutional right to fight for better conditions-zone or no zone. Zernan Toledo is the centre’s
most intense and radical organizer, and though he is only twenty-five and looks like a college
student, he runs the centre’s affairs with all the discipline of a revolutionary cell. "Outside the zone,
workers are free to organize a union, but inside they cannot stage pickets nor have demonstrations,"
Toledo told me in my two-hour "orientation session" at the centre. "Group discussions in the

factories are prohibited and we cannot enter the zone," he said, pointing to a diagram of the zone
layout hanging on the wall. This catch-22 exists throughout the quasi-private zones. As the
International Confederation of Free Trade Unions report puts it: "The workers are effectively living
in 'lawless' territory where to defend their rights and interests they are constantly forced to take
'illegal' action themselves."
In the Philippines, the zone's culture of incentives and exceptions, which was intended to be phased
out as the foreign companies joined the national economy, has had the opposite effect. Not only
have new swallows landed, but unionized factories already in the country have shut themselves
down and reopened inside the Cavite Export Processing Zone in order to take advantage of all the
incentives. For instance, Marks £t Spencer goods used to be manufactured in a unionized factory
north of Manila. "It only took ten trucks to bring Marks & Spencer to Cavite," a labour organizer in
the area told me. "The union was eliminated."
Cavite is by no means exceptional in this regard. Union organizing is a source of great fear
throughout the zones, where a successful drive can have dire consequences for both organizers and
workers. That was the lesson learned in December 1998, when the American shirt maker PhillipsVan Heusen closed down the only unionized export apparel factory in all of Guatemala, laying off
five hundred workers. The Camisas Modernas plant was unionized in 1997, after a long and bitter
organizing drive and significant pressure placed on the company by U.S. human-rights groups.
With the union, wages went up from US$56 a week to $71 and the previously squalid factory was
cleaned up. Jay Mazur, president of the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees
(UNITE) — America's largest apparel union — called the contract "a beacon of hope for more than
80,000 maquiladora workers in Guatemala." When the factory closed, however, the beacon of hope
turned into a flashing red danger signal, reinforcing the familiar warning: no union, no strike.
Patriotism and national duty are bound up in the exploitation of the export zones, with young
people — mostly women — sent off to sweatshop factories the way a previous generation of young
men were sent off to war. No questioning of authority is expected or permitted. In some Central
American and Asian EPZs, strikes are officially illegal; in Sri Lanka, it is illegal to do anything at
all that might jeopardize the country's export earnings, including publishing and distributing critical
material. In 1993, a Sri Lankan zone worker by the name of Ranjith Mudiyanselage was killed for
appearing to challenge this policy. After complaining about a faulty machine that had sliced off a
co-worker's finger, Mudiyanselage was abducted on his way out of an inquiry into the incident. His
body was found beaten and burning on a pile of old tires outside a local church. The man's legal
adviser, who had accompanied him to the inquiry, was murdered in the same way.
Despite the constant threat of retaliation, the Workers' Assistance Centre has made some modest
attempts to organize unions inside the Cavite zone factories, with varying degrees of success. For
instance, when a drive was undertaken at the All Asia garment factory, the organizers came up
against a very challenging obstacle: worker exhaustion. The biggest complaint among the All Asia
seamstresses who stitch clothes for Ellen Tracy and Sassoon is forced overtime. Regular shifts last
from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., but on a few nights a week employees must work "late" — until 2 a.m.
During peak periods, it is not uncommon to work two 2 a.m. shifts in a row, leaving many women
only a couple of hours of sleep before they have to start their commute back to the factory. But that
also means most All Asia workers spend their precious thirty-minute breaks at the factory napping,
not talking about unions. "I have a hard time talking with the workers because the workers are

always very sleepy," a mother of four tells me, explaining why she has had no luck in her attempts
to bring a union to the All Asia factory. She has been with the company for four years and still
lacks basic job security and health insurance.
Work in the zone is characterized by this brutal combination of tremendous intensity and
nonexistent job security. Everyone works six or seven days a week, and when a big order is due to
be shipped out, employees work until it is done. Most workers want some overtime hours because
they need the money, but the overnight shifts are widely considered a burden. Refusing to stay,
however, is not an option. For instance, according to the official rule book of the Philips factory (a
contractor that has filled orders for both Nike and Reebok), "Refusal to render overtime work when
so required" is an offence "punishable with dismissal." The same is true at all the factories I
encountered, and there are many reports of workers asking to leave early-before 2 a.m., for
instance-and being told not to return to work the next day.
Overtime horror stories pour out of the export processing zones, regardless of location: in China,
there are documented cases of three-day shifts, when workers are forced to sleep under their
machines. Contractors often face heavy financial penalties if they fail to deliver on time, no matter
how unreasonable the deadline. In Honduras, when filling out a particularly large order on a tight
deadline, factory managers have been reported injecting workers with amphetamines to keep them
going on forty-eight-hour marathons.

In Cavite, you can't talk about overtime without the conversation turning to Carmelita Alonzo, who
died, according to her co-workers, "of overwork." Alonzo, I was told again and again — by groups
of workers gathered at the Workers' Assistance Centre and by individual workers in one-on-one
interviews—was a seamstress at the V.T. Fashions factory, stitching clothes for the Gap and Liz
Claiborne, among many other labels. All of the workers I spoke with urgently wanted me to know
how this tragedy happened so that I could explain it to "the people in Canada who buy these
products." Carmelita Alonzo's death occurred following a long stretch of overnight shifts during a
particularly heavy peak season. "There were a lot of products for ship-out and no one was allowed
to go home," recalls Josie, whose denim factory is owned by the same firm as Carmelita's, and who
also faced large orders at that time. "In February, the line leader had overnights almost every night
for one week." Mot only had Alonzo been working those shifts, but she had a two-hour commute to
get back to her family. Suffering from pneumonia — a common illness in factories that are
suffocatingly hot during the day but fill with condensation at night — she asked her manager for
time off to recover. She was denied. Alonzo was eventually admitted to hospital, where she died on
March 8, 1997 — International Women's Day.
I asked a group of workers gathered late one evening around the long table at the centre how they
felt about what happened to Carmelita. The answers were confused at first. "Feel? But Carmelita is
us." But then Salvador, a sweet-faced twenty-two-year-old from a toy factory, said something that
made all of his co-workers nod in vigorous agreement. "Carmelita died because of working
overtime. It is possible to happen to any one of us," he explained, the words oddly incongruous
with his pale blue Beverly Hills 90210 T-shirt.

Much of the overtime stress could be alleviated if the factories would just hire more workers and
create two shorter shifts. But why should they? The government official appointed to oversee the
zone isn't interested in taking on the factory owners and managers at>out the overtime violations.
Raymondo Nagrampa, the zone administrator, acknowledged that it would certainly be better if the
factories hired more people for fewer hours, but, he told me, "I think I will leave that. I think this is
more of a management decision."
For their part, the factory owners are in no rush to expand the size of their workforce, because after
a big order is filled there could be a dry spell and they don't want to be stuck with more employees
than work. Since following Philippine labour law is "a management decision," most decide that it is
more convenient for management to have one pool of workers who are simply forced to work more
hours when there is more work and fewer when there is less of it. And this is the flip side of the
overtime equation: when a factory is experiencing a lull in orders or a shipment of supplies has
been delayed, workers are sent home without pay, sometimes for a week at a time. The group of
workers gathered around the table at the Workers' Assistance Centre burst out laughing when I
asked them about job security or a guaranteed number of working hours. "No work, no pay!" the
young men and women exclaim in unison.
The "no work, no pay" rule applies to all workers, contract or "regular." Contracts, when they exist,
last only five months or less, after which time workers have to "recontract." Many of the factory
workers in Cavite are actually hired through an employment agency, inside the zone walls, that
collects their checks and takes a cut-a temp agency for factory workers, in other words, and one
more level in the multiple-level system that lives off their labour. Management uses a variety of
tricks in the different zones to keep employees from achieving permanent status and collecting the
accompanying rights and benefits. In the Central American maquiladoras, it is a common practice
for factories to fire workers at the end of the year and rehire them a few weeks later so that they
don't have to grant them permanent status; in the Thai zones, the same practice is known as "hire
and fire." In China, many workers in the zones have no contracts at all, which leaves them without
any rights or recourse whatsoever.
It is in this casual new relationship to factory employment that the EPZ system breaks down
completely. In principle, the zones are an ingenious mechanism for global wealth redistribution.
Yes, they lure jobs from the North, but few fair-minded observers would deny the proposition that
as industrialized nations shift to higher-tech economies, it is only a matter of global justice that the
jobs upon which our middle classes were built should be shared with countries still enslaved by
poverty. The problem is that the workers in Cavite, and in zones throughout Asia and Latin
America, are not inheriting "our" jobs at all. Gerard Greenfield, former research director of the
Asian Monitoring and Resource Centre in Hong Kong, says, "One of the myths of relocation is that
those jobs that seemed to be transferred from the so-called North to the South are perceived as
similar jobs to what was already being done before." They are not. Just as company-owned
manufacturing turned — somewhere over the Pacific Ocean — into "orders" to be placed with
third-party contractors, so did full-time employment undergo a mid-flight transformation into
"contracts." "The biggest challenge to those in Asia," says Greenfield, "is that the new employment
created by Western and Asian multinationals investing in Asia is temporary and short-term
employment."

In fact, zone workers in many parts of Asia, the Caribbean and Central America have more in
common with office-temp workers in North America and Europe than they do with factory workers
in those Northern countries. What is happening in the EPZs is a radical alteration in the very nature
of factory work. That was the conclusion of a 1996 study conducted by the International Labour
Organization, which stated that the dramatic relocation of production in the garment and shoe
industries "has been accompanied by a parallel shift of production from the formal to the informal
sector in many countries, with generally negative consequences on wage levels and conditions of
work." Employment in these sectors, the study went on, has shifted from "full-time in-plant jobs to
part-time and temporary jobs and, especially in clothing and footwear, increasing resort to
homework and small shops."
Indeed, this is not simply a job-flight story.

On my last night in Cavite, I met a group of six teenage girls in the workers' dormitories who
shared a six-by-eight-foot concrete room: four slept on the makeshift bunk bed (two to a bed), the
other two on mats spread on the floor. The girls who made Aztek, Apple and IBM CD-ROM drives
shared the top bunk; the ones who sewed Gap clothing, the bottom. All were the children of
farmers, away from their families for the first time.
Their jam-packed shoebox of a home had the air of an apocalyptic slumber party-part prison cell,
part Sixteen Candles. It may have been a converted pigsty, but these were sixteen-year-old girls,
and like teenage girls the world over they had covered the grey, stained walls with pictures: of
fluffy animals, Filipino action-movie stars, and glossy magazine ads of women modelling lacy bras
and underwear. After a little while, serious talk of working conditions erupted into fits of giggles
and hiding under bedcovers. It seems that my questions reminded two of the girls of a crush they
had on a labour organizer who had recently given a seminar at the Workers' Assistance Centre on
the risks of infertility from working with hazardous chemicals.
Were they worried about infertility?
"Oh, yes. Very worried now."
All through the Asian zones, the roads are lined with teenage girls in blue shirts, holding hands with
their friends and carrying umbrellas to shield them from the sun. They look like students coming
home from school. In Cavite, as elsewhere, the vast majority of workers are unmarried women
between the ages of seventeen and twenty-five. Like the girls in the dorms, roughly 80 percent of
the workers have migrated from other provinces of the Philippines to work in the factories — a
mere 5 percent are native to the town of Rosario. Like the swallow factories, they too are only
tenuously connected to this place. Raymondo Nagrampa, the zone administrator, says migrants are
recruited for the zone to compensate for something innate in "the Cavite character," something that
makes local people unfit to work in the factories situated near their homes. "I don't mean any
offence to the Cavite personality," he explained, in his spacious air-conditioned office. "But from
what I gather, this particular character is not suited for the factory life — they'd rather go into
something quickly. They do not have the patience to be right there in the factory line." Nagrampa
attributes this to the fact that Rosario is so close to Manila "and so we can say that the Cavitenians
are not running scared with regard to getting some income for their daily subsistence....

"But in the case of those from the provinces, from the lower areas, they are not exposed to the bigcity lifestyle. They feel more comfortable just working in the factory line, for, after all, this is a
marked improvement from the farm work that they've been accustomed to, where they were
exposed to the sun. To them, for the lowly province rural worker, working inside an enclosed
factory is better off than being outside."
I asked dozens of zone workers — all of them migrants from rural areas — about what Raymondo
Nagrampa had said. Every one of them responded with outrage.
"It's not human!" exclaimed Rosalie, a teenager whose job is installing the "backlights" in IBM
computer screens. "Our rights are being trampled and Mr. Nagrampa says that because he has not
experienced working in a factory and the conditions inside."
Salvador, in his 90210 T-shirt, was beside himself: "Mr. Nagrampa earns a lot of money and he has
an air-conditioned room and his own car, so of course he would say that we prefer this work —it is
beneficial to him, but not to us.... Working on the farm is difficult, yes, but there we have our
family and friends and instead of always eating dried fish, we have fresh food to eat."
His words clearly struck a chord with a homesick Rosalie: "I want to be together with my family in
the province," she said quietly, looking even younger than her nineteen years. "It's better there
because when I get sick, my parents are there, but here there is no one to take care of me."
Many other rural workers told me that they would have stayed home if they could, but the choice
was made for them: most of their families had lost their farms, displaced by golf courses, botched
land-reform laws and more export processing zones. Others said that the only reason they came to
Cavite was that when the zone recruiters came to their villages, they promised that workers would
earn enough in the factories to send money home to their impoverished families. The same
inducement had been offered to other girls their age, they told me, to go to Manila to work in the
sex trade.
Several more young women wanted to tell me about those promises, too. The problem, they said, is
that no matter how long they work in the zone; there is never more than a few pesos left over to
send home. "If we had land we would just stay there to cultivate the land for our needs," Raquel, a
teenage girl from one of the garment factories, told me. "But we are landless, so we have no choice
but to work in the economic zone even though it is very hard and the situation here is very unfair.
The recruiters said we would get a high income, but in my experience, instead of sending my
parents money, I cannot maintain even my own expenses."
So the workers in Cavite have lost on all counts: they are penniless and homeless. It's a potent
combination. In the dormitories, sleep deprivation, malnutrition and homesickness mingle to create
an atmosphere of deep dis-orientation. "We are alien in the factories. We are also alien in the
boarding-house because we all come from faraway provinces," Liza, an electronics worker, told me.
"We are strangers here."
Cecille Tuico, one of the organizers at the Workers' Assistance Centre, was listening in on the
conversation. After the workers left to make their way through Rosario's dark streets and back to

the dormitories, she pointed out that the alienation the workers so poignantly describe is precisely
what the employers look for when they seek out migrants instead of locals to work in the zone.
With the same muted, matter-of-fact anger I have come to recognize in so many Filipino humanrights activists, Tuico said that the factory managers prefer young women who are far from home
and have not finished high school, because "they are scared and uneducated about their rights."

Their naiveté and insecurity undoubtedly make discipline easier for factory managers, but younger
workers are preferred for other reasons, too. Women are often fired from their zone jobs in their
mid-twenties, told by supervisors that they are "too old," and that their fingers are no longer
sufficiently nimble. This practice is a highly effective way of minimizing the number of mothers on
the company payroll. In Cavite, the workers tell me stories about pregnant women forced to work
until 2 a.m., even after pleading with the supervisor; of women who work in the ironing section
giving birth to babies with burns on their skin; of women who mould the plastic for cordless phones
giving birth to stillborn infants. The evidence I hear in Cavite is anecdotal, told to me quietly and
urgently by women with the same terrified expression I saw when conversation turned to Carmelita
Alonzo. Some of the stories are certainly apocryphal — fear-fuelled zone legends — but the abuse
of pregnant women in export processing zones is also well documented and the problem reaches far
beyond Cavite.
Because most zone employers want to avoid paying benefits, assigning workers to a predictable
schedule or offering any job security, motherhood has become the scourge of these pink-collar
zones. A study by Human Rights Watch that has become the basis for a grievance under the
NAFTA side agreement on labour found that women applying for jobs in the Mexican
maquiladoras routinely had to undergo pregnancy tests. The study, which implicates such investors
in the zones as Zenith, Panasonic, General Electric, General Motors and Fruit of the Loom, found
that "pregnant women are denied hiring. Moreover, maquiladora employers sometimes mistreat and
discharge pregnant employees." The researchers uncovered mistreatment designed to encourage
workers to resign: pregnant women were required to work the night shift, or to take on
exceptionally long hours of unpaid overtime and physically strenuous tasks. They were also refused
time off work to go to the doctor, a practice that has led to on-the-job miscarriages. "In this way,"
the study reports, "a pregnant worker is forced to choose between having a healthy, full-term
pregnancy and keeping her job."
Other methods of sidestepping the costs and responsibilities of employing workers with children
are reported on a more haphazard basis throughout the zones. In Honduras and El Salvador the
garbage dumps in the zones are littered with empty packets of contraceptive pills that are reportedly
passed out on the factory floor. In the Honduran zones there have been reports of management
forcing workers to have abortions. At some Mexican maquiladoras, women are required to prove
they are menstruating through such humiliating practices as monthly sanitary-pad checks.
Employees are kept on twenty-eight-day contracts — the length of the average menstrual cycle —
making it easy, as soon as a pregnancy comes to light, for the worker to be dismissed. In a Sri
Lankan zone, one worker was reported to be so terrified of losing her job after giving birth that she
drowned her newborn baby in a toilet.

The widespread assault on women's reproductive freedoms in the zones is the most brutal
expression of the failure on the part of many consumer-goods corporations to live up to their
traditional role as mass employers. Today's "new deal" with workers is a non-deal; one-time
manufacturers, turned marketing mavens, are so resolutely intent on evading any and all
commitments that they are creating a workforce of childless women, a system of footloose factories
employing footloose workers. In a letter to Human Rights Watch explaining why it discriminated
against pregnant women in the maquiladoras, General Motors stated plainly that it "will not hire
female job applicants found to be pregnant" in an effort to avoid "substantial financial liabilities
imposed by the Mexican social security system." Since the critical report was published, GM has
changed the policy. It remains, however, a stark contrast to the days when the company made it a
banner policy that the adult men working in its auto plants should earn enough not only to support a
family of four but to drive them around in a GM car or truck. General Motors has cut about 82,000
jobs in the U.S. since 1991 and expects to cut another 40,000 by the year 2003, moving production
to the maquiladoras and their clones around the globe. A far cry from those days when it proudly
proclaimed, "What's good for General Motors is good for the country."

Within this reengineered system, the workers aren't the only ones on a day pass. The swallow
factories that employ them have been built to maximize flexibility: to follow the tax breaks and
incentives, to bend with the currency devaluations and benefit by the strict rule of dictators. In
North America and Europe, job flight is a threat with which workers have become all too familiar.
A study commissioned by the NAFTA labour commission found that in the United States, between
1993 and 1995, "employers threatened to close the plant in 50 percent of all union certification
elections.... Specific, unambiguous threats ranged from attaching shipping labels to equipment
throughout the plant with a Mexican address, to posting maps of North America with an arrow
pointing from the current plant site to Mexico." The study found that the employers followed
through on the threats, shutting down all or part of newly unionized plants, in 15 percent of these
cases — triple the closing rate of the pre-NAFTA 1980s. In China, Indonesia, India and the
Philippines the threat of plant closure and job flight is even more powerful. Since the industries are
quick to flee escalating wages, environmental regulation and taxes, factories are made to be mobile.
Some of these swallow factories may well be on their third or even fourth flight, and as the history
of subcontracting makes clear, they touch down more lightly at each new stop.
When the flying multinationals first landed in Taiwan, Korea and Japan, many of their factories
were owned and operated by local contractors. In Pusan, South Korea, for instance — known
during the eighties as "the sneaker capital of the world" —Korean entrepreneurs ran factories for
Reebok, L.A. Gear and Nike. But when, in the late eighties, Korean workers began to rebel against
their dollar-a-day wages and formed trade unions to fight for better conditions, the swallows once
again took flight. Between 1987 and 1992, 30,000 factory jobs were lost in Korea's export
processing zones, and in less than three years one-third of the shoe jobs had disappeared. The story
is much the same in Taiwan. The migration patterns have been clearly documented with Reebok's
manufacturers. In 1985, Reebok produced almost all its sneakers in South Korea and Taiwan and
none in Indonesia and China. By 1995, nearly all those factories had flown out of Korea and
Taiwan and 60 percent of Reebok's contracts had landed in Indonesia and China.

But on this new leg of the journey, the factories were not owned by local Indonesian and Chinese
contractors. Instead they were owned and run by the same Korean and Taiwanese companies that
ran them before the move. When the multinationals pulled their orders from Korea and Taiwan,
their contractors followed, closing up shop in their home countries and building the new factories in
countries where labour was still cheap: China, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines. One of
these contractors — the largest single supplier for Reebok, Adidas and Nike —is a Taiwaneseowned company called Yue Yuen. Yue Yuen has closed most of its factories in its homeland of
Taiwan and chased the low wages to China, where it employs 54,000 people in a single factory
complex. For Chi Neng Tsai, one of the company's owners, it simply makes good business sense to
go where the workers are hungry: "Thirty years ago, when Taiwan was hungry, we also were more
productive," he says.
Taiwanese and Korean bosses are uniquely positioned to exploit this hunger: they can tell workers
from personal experience what happens when unions come in and wages go up. And maintaining
contractors who have had the rug pulled out from under them once before is a stroke of
management genius on the part of the Western multinationals. What better way to keep costs down
than to make yesterday's casualties today's wardens?
It is a system that doesn't do much for the sense of stability in Cavite, or for the Philippine economy
in general, which is already unusually vulnerable to global forces, since the majority of its
companies are owned by foreign investors. As Filipino economist Antonio Tujan told me, "The
contractors have displaced the Filipino middleman." In fact, Tujan, the director of a Manila-based
think tank highly critical of Philippine economic policy, corrects me when I refer to the buildings I
saw inside the Cavite Export Processing Zone as "factories." They aren't factories, he says, "they
are labour warehouses."
He explains that since all the materials are imported, nothing is actually manufactured in the
factories, only assembled. (The components are manufactured in yet another country, where the
workers are more highly skilled, though still cheaper than U.S. or European workers.) It's true, now
that Tujan mentions it, that when I climbed up the water tower and looked down on the zone, part
of what contributed to the unbearable lightness of Cavite was that apart from one incinerator, there
were no smokestacks. That's a bonus for the air quality in Rosario but odd for an industrial park of
Cavite's size. Neither was there any local rhyme or reason to what was being produced. When I
walked the zone's freshly paved streets, I was surprised by the variety of manufacturing going on.
Like most people, I had thought that Asian export zones were mostly filled with garment and
electronics producers, but not Cavite: a factory making car seats sat next to one making sneakers,
across the way from a factory with dozens of aluminium speedboats piled up by its gate. On another
street, the open doors of a factory revealed racks of dresses and jackets, right next to the plant
where Salvador made novelty key chains and other small toys. "You see?" says Antonio Tujan.
"We have a country whose industry is so deformed, so unbelievably mishmash, that it cannot exist
by itself. It's all a myth, you know. They talk about industrialization in the context of globalization,
but it's all a myth."
Mo wonder the promise of industrialization in Cavite feels more like a threat. The place is a
development mirage.

The fear that the flighty multinationals will once again pull their orders and migrate to more
favourable conditions underlies everything that takes place in the zones. It makes for an odd
dissonance: despite the fact that they have no local physical holdings — they don't own the
buildings, land or equipment — brands like Nike, the Gap and IBM are omnipresent, invisibly
pulling all the strings. They are so powerful as buyers that the hands-on involvement owning the
factories would entail has come to look, from their perspective, like needless micromanagement.
And because the actual owners and factory managers are completely dependent on their large
contracts to make the machines run, workers are left in a uniquely weak bargaining position: you
can't sit down and bargain with an order form. So even the classic Marxist division between
workers and owners doesn't quite work in the zone, since the brand-name multinationals have
divested the "means of production," to use Marx's phrase, unwilling to encumber themselves with
the responsibilities of actually owning and managing the factories, and employing a labour force.
If anything, the multinationals have more power over production by not owning the factories. Like
most committed shoppers, they see no need to concern themselves with how their bargains were
produced — they simply pounce on them, keeping the suppliers on their toes by taking bids from
slews of other contractors. One contractor, Young 11 Kim of Guatemala, whose Sam Lucas factory
produces clothing for Wal-Mart and J.C. Penney, says of his big-brand clients, "They're interested
in a high-quality garment, fast delivery, and cheap sewing charges — and that's all." In this
cutthroat context, each contractor swears he could deliver the goods cheaper if the brands would
only start producing in Africa, Vietnam or Bangladesh, or if they would shift to home workers.
More blatantly, the power of the brands may occasionally be invoked to affect public policy in the
countries where export zones are located. Companies or their emissaries may make public
statements about how a raise in the legal minimum wage could price a certain Asian country "out of
the market," as Mike's and Reebok's contractors have been quick to tell the Indonesian government
whenever strikes get out of hand. Calling a strike at a Mike factory "intolerable," Anton Supit,
chairman of the Indonesian Footwear Association, which represents contractors for Mike, Reebok
and Adidas, called on the Indonesian military to intervene. "If the authorities don't handle strikes,
especially ones leading to violence and brutality, we will lose our foreign buyers. The government's
income from exports will decrease and unemployment will worsen." The corporate shoppers may
also help draft international trade agreements to reduce quotas and tariffs, or even lobby a
government directly to loosen regulations. In describing the conditions under which Mike decided
to begin "sourcing" its shoes in China, for instance, company vice president David Chang explained
that "one of the first things we told the Chinese was that their prices had to be more competitive
with our other Far East sources because the cost of doing business in China was so enormous....
The hope is for a 20 percent price advantage over Korea." After all, what price-conscious consumer
doesn't comparison shop? And if a shift to a more "competitive" country causes mass layoffs
somewhere else in the world, that is somebody else's blood on somebody else's hands. As Levi's
CEO Robert Haas said, "This is not a job-flight story."
Multinational corporations have vehemently defended themselves against the accusation that they
are orchestrating a "race to the bottom" by claiming that their presence has helped to raise the
standard of living in underdeveloped countries. As Mike CEO Phil Knight said in 1996, "For the
past 25 years, Nike has provided good jobs, improved labour practices and raised standards of
living wherever we operate." Confronted with the starvation wages in Haiti, a Disney spokesperson

told The Globe and Mail, "It's a process all developing countries go through, like Japan and Korea,
who were at this stage decades ago." And there is no shortage of economists to spin the mounting
revelations of corporate abuse, claiming that sweatshops are not a sign of eroded rights but a signal
that prosperity is just around the corner. "My concern," said famed Harvard economist Jeffrey D.
Sachs, "is not that there are too many sweatshops but that there are too few...those are precisely the
jobs that were the stepping stones for Singapore and Hong Kong and those are the jobs that have to
come to Africa to get them out of back-breaking rural poverty." Sachs's colleague Paul Krugman
concurred, arguing that in the developing world the choice is not between bad jobs and good jobs
but between bad jobs and no jobs. "The overwhelming mainstream view among economists is that
the growth of this kind of employment is tremendous good news for the world's poor."
The no-pain-no-gain defence of sweatshops, however, took a severe beating when the currencies of
those very countries supposedly benefiting most from this development model began crashing like
cheap plates. First in Mexico, then Thailand, South Korea, the Philippines and Indonesia, workers
were, and in many cases still are, bringing home minimum-wage pay checks worth less than when
the "economic miracle" first came to bless their nations years ago. Nike's public-relations director,
Vada Manager, used to claim that "the job opportunities that we have provided to women and men
in developing economies like Vietnam and Indonesia have provided a bridge of opportunity for
these individuals to have a much better quality of life," but by the winter of 1998, nobody knew
better than Nike that that bridge had collapsed. With currency devaluation and soaring inflation,
real wages in Nike's Indonesian factories fell by 45 percent in 1998. In July of that year, Indonesian
president B.J. Habibie urged his 200 million citizens to do their part to conserve the country's
dwindling rice supply by fasting for two days out of each week, from dawn until dusk.
Development built on starvation wages, far from kick-starting a steady improvement in conditions,
has proved to be a case of one step forward, three steps back. And by early 1998 there were no
more shining Asian Tigers to point to, and those corporations and economists that had mounted
such a singular defence of sweatshops had had their arguments entirely discredited. The fear of
flying has been looming large in Cavite of late. The currency began its downward spiral a few
weeks before I arrived, and since then conditions have only worsened. By early 1999, the price of
basic commodities like cooking oil, sugar, chicken and soap had increased by as much as 36
percent from the year before. Pay checks that barely made ends meet now no longer accomplish
even that. Workers who had begun to find the courage to stand up to management are now living
not only under the threat of mass layoffs and factory flight but with the reality. In 1998, 3,072
businesses in the Philippines either closed down or scaled back operation —a 166 percent increase
over the year before. For its part, Nike has laid off 268 workers at the Philips factory, where I had
seen, through the surrounding fence, the shoes lying in great piles. A few months later, in February
1999, Nike pulled out of two other Philippine factories as well, these ones located in the nearby
Bataan export zone; 1,505 workers were affected by the closures. But Phil Knight didn't have to do
the dirty work himself—he just cut the orders and left the rest to the contractors. Like the factories
themselves, these job losses went unswooshed.
The transience woven into the fabric of free-trade zones is an extreme manifestation of the
corporate divestment of the world of work, which is taking place at all levels of industry. Cavite
may be capitalism's dream vacation, but casualization is a game that can be played at home, and
contracting out, as Business Week reporter Aaron Bernstein has written, is trickling up. "While
outsourcing started in manufacturing in the early 1980s, it has expanded through virtually every
industry as companies rush to shed staff in everything from human resources to computer systems."

The same impetus that lies behind the brands-versus-products and contracts-versus-jobs conflict is
fuelling the move to temp, part-time, freelance and homework in North America and Europe, as we
will see in the next chapter.
This is not a job-flight story. It is a flight-from-jobs story.

A sense of impermanence is blowing through the labour force, destabilizing everyone from office
temps to high-tech independent contractors to restaurant and retail clerks. Factory jobs are being
outsourced, garment jobs are morphing into homework, and in every industry, temporary contracts
are replacing full, secure employment. In a growing number of instances, even CEOs are opting for
shorter stints at one corporation after another, breezing in and out of different corner offices and
purging half the employees as they come and go.
Almost every major labour battle of the decade has focused not on wage issues but on enforced
casualization, from the United Parcel Service workers' stand against "part-time America" to the
unionized Australian dockworkers fighting their replacement by contract workers, to the Canadian
autoworkers at Ford and Chrysler striking against the outsourcing of their jobs to non-union
factories. All these stories are about different industries doing variations on the same thing: finding
ways to cut ties to their workforce and travel light. The underbelly of the shiny "brands, not
products" revelation can be seen increasingly in every workplace around the globe. Every
corporation wants a fluid reserve of part-timers, temps and freelancers to help it keep overheads
down and ride the twists and turns in the market. As British management consultant Charles Handy

says, savvy companies prefer to see themselves as "organizers" of collections of contractors, as
opposed to "employment organizations."' One thing is certain: offering employment-the steady
kind, with benefits, holiday pay, a measure of security and maybe even union representation — has
fallen out of economic fashion.

Though an entire class of consumer-goods companies has transcended the need to produce what it
sells, so far not even the most weightless multinational has been able to free itself entirely from the
burden of employees. Production may be relegated to contractors, but clerks are still needed to sell
the brand-name goods at the point of purchase, especially given the growth of branded retail. In the
service industry, however, big-brand employers have become artful at dodging most commitments
to their employees, expertly fostering the notion that their clerks are somehow not quite legitimate
workers, and thus do not really need or deserve job security, liveable wages and benefits.
Most of the large employers in the service sector manage their workforce as if their clerks didn't
depend on their pay checks for anything essential, such as rent or child support. Instead, retail and
service employers tend to view their employees as children: students looking for summer jobs,
spending money or a quick stopover on the road to a more fulfilling and better-paying career. These
are great jobs, in other words, for people who don't really need them. And so the mall and the
superstore have given birth to a ballooning subcategory of joke jobs —the frozen-yogurt jerk, the
Orange Julius juicer, the Gap greeter, the Prozac-happy Wal-Mart "sales associate" — that are
notoriously unstable, low-paying and overwhelmingly part-time. What is distressing about this
trend is that over the past two decades, the relative importance of the service sector as a source of
jobs has soared. The decline in manufacturing, as well as the waves of downsizing and cutbacks in
the public sector, have been met by dramatic growth in the numbers of service-sector jobs to the
extent that services and retail now account for 75 percent of total U.S. employment. Today, there
are four and a half times as many Americans selling clothes in specialty and department stores as
there are workers stitching and weaving them, and Wal-Mart isn't just the biggest retailer in the
world, it is also the largest private employer in the United States.
And yet despite these shifts in employment patterns, most brand-name retail, service and restaurant
chains have opted to put on economic blinders, insisting that they are still offering hobby jobs for
kids. Never mind that the service sector is now filled with workers who have multiple university
degrees, immigrants unable to find manufacturing jobs, laid-off nurses and teachers, and downsized
middle managers. Never mind, too, that the students who do work in retail and fast food — as many
of them do - are facing higher tuition costs, less financial assistance from parents and government
and more years in school. Never mind that the food service workforce has been steadily aging over
the last decade so that more than half are now over twenty-five years old. Or that a 1997 study
found that 25 percent of non-management Canadian retail workers had been with the same
company for eleven years or more and that 39 percent had been there for between four and ten
years. That's a lot longer than "Chainsaw" Al Dunlap lasted as CEO of Sunbeam Corp. But never
mind all that. Everyone knows that a job in the service sector is a hobby, and retail is a place where
people go for "experience," not a livelihood.
Nowhere has this message been more successfully absorbed than at the cash register and the takeout
counter, where many workers say they feel as if they are just passing through even after logging a

decade in the McWork sector. Brenda Hilbrich, who works at Borders Books and Music in
Manhattan, explains how difficult it is to reconcile the quality of her employment with a sense of
personal success: "You're stuck with this dichotomy of Tm supposed to do better but yet I can't
because I can't find another job.' So you tell yourself, 'I'm only here temporarily because I'm going
to find something better.'" This internalized state of perpetual transience has been convenient for
service-sector employers who have been free to let wages stagnate and to provide little room for
upward mobility, since there is no urgent need to improve the conditions of jobs that everyone
agrees are only temporary. Borders clerk Jason Chappell says that the retail chains work hard to
reinforce feelings of transience in their workers in order to protect this highly profitable formula.
"So much of the company propaganda is convincing you that you're not workers, that it's something
else, that you're not working class.... Everyone thinks they are middle class even when they're
making $13,000 a year."

I met with Chappell and Hilbrich late one night in October 1997, at a deli in Manhattan's financial
district. We chose this place because it was close to the Borders outlet at the base of the World
Trade Centre where they both work. I had heard about the pair because of their successful efforts to
bring a union to Borders, part of a flurry of labour organizing inside the large chains since the midnineties: at Starbucks, Barnes & Noble, Wal-Mart, Kentucky Fried Chicken, McDonald's. It seems
as if more and more of the twenty-something-going-on-thirty-something clerks working for the
super-brands are looking around — at the counters in front of them where they serve Sumatran
coffee, and at the best-selling books, and made-in-China sweaters — and are acknowledging that,
for better or worse, some of them aren't going anywhere fast. Laurie Bonang, who works at
Starbucks in Vancouver, British Columbia, told me that "people our age are finally realizing that
we get out of university, we're a zillion dollars in debt, and we're working in Starbucks. This isn't
how we want to spend the rest of our lives, but for right now the dream job isn't waiting for us
anymore.... I was hoping that Starbucks would be a stepping stone to bigger and better things, but
unfortunately it's a stepping stone to a big sinkhole."
As Bonang told her story, she was painfully aware that she is living out one of the most hackneyed
pop-culture clichés of our branded age: this is the stuff of Saturday Night life's "Gap Girls" skit,
circa 1993, in which bored, underemployed mall chicks ask each other: "Didja cinch it?" Or of the
Starbucks "baristas" who rattle off long trains of coffee adjectives - grande-decaf-low-fatmoccacino - in movies like You've Got Mail. But there is a reason why the most vocally unhappy
service-sector workers are the ones working for the highest-profile global retailers and restaurants.
Large chains such as Wal-Mart, Starbucks and the Gap, as they have proliferated since the mideighties, have been lowering workplace standards in the service sector, fuelling their marketing
budgets, imperialistic expansion and high-concept "retail experiences" by lowballing their clerks on
wages and hours. Most of the big-name brands in the service sector pay the legal minimum wage or
slightly more, even though the average wage for retail workers is several dollars higher. Wal-Mart
clerks in the U.S., for instance, earn an average of $7.50 an hour and since Wal-Mart classifies "full
time" as twenty-eight hours a week, the average annual income is $10,920-significantly less than
the industry average. Kmart wages are also low and the benefits are considered so substandard that
when a 172,000-square-foot Super Kmart opened in San Jose, California, in October 1997, the local
city council voted to endorse a boycott of the retailer. Council member Margie Fernandes said that
the low wages, minimal health benefits and part-time hours are far below those provided by other
area retailers, and that these are not the kind of jobs the community needs. "San Jose is a very, very
expensive place to live and we need to make sure the people who work here can afford to live
here," Fernandes explained.
McDonald's and Starbucks staff, meanwhile, frequently earn less than the employees of singleoutlet restaurants and cafes, which explains why McDonald's is widely credited for pioneering the
throwaway "McJob" that the entire fast-food industry has since moved to emulate. At Britain's
McLibel Trial, in which the company contested claims made by two Greenpeace activists about its
employment practices, international trade unionist Dan Gallin defined a McJob as "a low skill, low
pay, high stress, exhausting and unstable job." Though the activists on trial for libel were found
guilty on several counts, in his verdict Chief Justice Rodger Bell ruled that in the matter of McJobs
the defendants had a point. The chain has had a negative impact on food-service wages as a whole,

he wrote, and the allegation that McDonald's "pays its workers low wages, helping to depress
wages for workers in the catering trade in Britain has been proved to be true. It is justified."
As we have seen in Cavite, the brand-name multinationals have freed themselves of the burden of
providing employees with a living wage. In the malls of North America and England, on the high
street, in the food court and at the superstore, they have managed a similar trick. In some cases,
particularly in the garment sector, these retailers are the very same companies that are doing
business in the export processing zones, meaning that their responsibilities as employers have been
sharply reduced at both the production and service ends of the economic cycle. Wal-Mart and the
Gap, for instance, contract out their production to EPZs dotting the Southern Hemisphere, where
goods are produced mostly by women in their teens and twenties who earn minimum wage or less
and live in cramped dorm rooms. Those goods — sweatshirts, baby clothes, toys and Walkmans —
are then sold by another workforce, concentrated in the North, which is also largely filled with
young people earning approximately minimum wage, most in their teens and early twenties.
Though in many ways it is indecent to compare the relative privilege of retail workers at the mall
with the abuse and exploitation suffered by zone workers, there is an undeniable pattern at work. In
general, the corporations in question have ensured that they do not have to confront the possibility
that adults with families are depending on the wages that they pay, whether at the mall or in the
zone. Just as factory jobs that once supported families have been reconfigured in the Third World as
jobs for teenagers, so have the brand-name clothing companies and restaurant chains given
legitimacy to the idea that fast-food and retail-sector jobs are disposable, and unfit for adults.
As in the zones, the youthfulness of the sector is far from accidental. It reflects a distinct preference
on the part of service-sector employers, achieved through a series of overt and covert management
actions. Young workers are consistently hired over older ones, and workers who have been on staff
for a few years —building up higher wages and seniority — often report losing precious shifts to
new batches of younger and cheaper clerks. Other anti-adult tactics have included the targeting of
older workers for harassment — the issue that sewed as the catalyst for the first strike at a
McDonald's outlet. In April 1998, after witnessing a verbally abusive supervisor reduce an elderly
co-worker to tears, the teenage workers at the Golden Arches in Macedonia, Ohio, walked off the
job in protest. They didn't return until management agreed to undergo "people skills" training. "We
get verbally harassed, and physically too. Not me, but basically just the elderly woman," teen
striker Bryan Drapp said on Good Morning America. Drapp was fired two months later.
Brenda Hilbrich of Borders contends that justifying low wages on the grounds that young workers
are just passing through is a handy self-fulfilling prophecy —particularly in her field, bookselling.
"It doesn't have to have a high turnover," she says. "If the conditions are good and you're making a
nice salary, people actually like working in the service industry.
They like working with books. A lot of people who have left have said, 'This was my favourite job,
but I had to go because I can't make enough money to live.'"

The fact is that the economy needs steady jobs that adults can live on. And it's clear that many
people would stay in retail if it paid adult rates, the proof being that when the sector does pay
decently, it attracts older workers, and the rate of staff turnover falls in line with the rest of the
economy. But at the large chains, which seem at least for now to have bottomless resources to build
superstores and to sink millions into expanding and synergizing their brands, the idea of paying a
living wage is rarely considered. At Borders, where most clerks earn wages in line with other
bookstore chains but below the retail average, company president Richard L. Flanagan wrote a
letter to all his clerks, addressing the question of whether Borders could pay a "living wage" as
opposed to what it reportedly pays now-between US$6.63 and $9.27 an hour. "While the concept is
romantically appealing," he wrote, "it ignores the practicalities and realities of our business
environment."
Much of what makes paying a living wage seem so "romantic" has to do with the rapid expansion
described in Part 11, "No Choice." For companies whose business plans depend upon becoming
dominant in their market before their nearest competitor beats them to it, new outlets come before
workers —even when those workers are a key part of the chain's image. "They expect us to look
like a Gap ad, professional, clean and neat all the time, and I can't even pay to do laundry," says
Laurie Bonang of Starbucks. "You can buy two grande mocha cappuccinos with my hourly salary."
Like millions of her demographic coevals on the payrolls of all-star brands like the Gap, Nike and
Barnes & Noble, Bonang is living inside a stunning corporate success story —though you'd never
know it from the resignation and anger in her voice. All the brand-name retail workers I spoke with
expressed their frustration at helping their stores rake in, to them, unimaginable profits, and then
having to watch that profit get funnelled into compulsive expansion. Employee wages, meanwhile,
stagnate or even decline. At Starbucks in British Columbia new workers faced an actual wage
decrease — from Can$7.50 to $7 an hour — during a period when the chain was doubling its
profits and opening 350 new stores a year. "I do the banking. I know how much the store pulls in a
week," Laurie Bonang says. "They just take all that revenue and open up new stores."
Borders clerks also maintain that wages have suffered as a result of rapid growth. They say that
their chain used to be a more equitable place to work before the neck-and-neck race with Barnes &
Noble took over corporate priorities; there was a profit-sharing program and a biannual 5 percent
raise for all workers. "Then came expansion and corresponding cuts," reads a statement from
disgruntled employees at a downtown Philadelphia outlet of Borders. "Profit sharing was dropped,
raises were cut..."
In sharp contrast to the days when corporate employees took pride in their company's growth,
seeing it as the result of a successful group effort, many clerks have come to see themselves as
being in direct competition with their employers' expansion dreams. "If Borders opened thirty-eight
new stores a year instead of forty," reasoned Jason Chappell, sitting next to Brenda Hilbrich on the
vinyl seats of our deli booth, "they could afford to give us a nice wage increase. On average it costs
$7 million to open a superstore. That's Borders' own figures...."
"But," Brenda interrupted, "if you say that directly to them, they say, 'Well, that's two markets we
don't get into.'"
"We have to saturate markets," Chappell said, nodding.

"Yeah," Brenda added. "We have to compete with Barnes & Noble."
The retail clerks employed by the superchains are only too familiar with the manic logic of
expansion.

The need to prevent workers from weighing too heavily on the bottom line is the main reason that
the branded chains have fought off the recent wave of unionization with such ferocity. McDonald's,
for instance, has been embroiled in bribery scandals during German union drives, and over the
course of a 1994 union drive in France, ten McDonald's managers were arrested for violating labour
laws and trade-union rights. In June 1998, the company fired the two young workers who organized
the strike in Macedonia, Ohio. In 1997, when the employees at a Windsor, Ontario, Wal-Mart were
about to hold an election on joining a union, a series of not-so-subtle management hints led many
workers to believe that if they voted yes their store would be shut down. The Ontario Labour
Relations Board reviewed the process and found that the behaviour of Wal-Mart managers and
supervisors before the vote amounted to "a subtle but extremely effective threat," which caused "the
average reasonable employee to conclude that the store would close if the union got in."
Other chains have not hesitated to make good on the threat to close. In 1997, Starbucks decided to
shut down its Vancouver distribution plant after workers unionized. In February 1998, just as a
union certification for a Montreal-area outlet of McDonald's was being reviewed by the Quebec
Labour Commission, the franchise owner closed down the outlet. Shortly after the closure, the
labour commission accredited the union — cold comfort, since no one works there anymore. Six
months later, another McDonald's restaurant was successfully unionized, this one a busy outlet in
Squamish, British Columbia, near the Whistler ski resort. The organizers were two teenage girls,
one sixteen, the other seventeen. It wasn't about wages, they said — they were just tired of being
scolded like children in front of the customers. The outlet remains open, making it the only
unionized McDonald's in North America, but at the time of writing, the company was on the verge
of having the union decertified. Fighting the battle on the public-relations front, in mid-1999 the
fast-food chain launched an international television campaign featuring McDonald's workers
serving up shakes and fries under the captions "future lawyer," "future engineer" and so on. Here
was the true McDonald's workforce, the company seemed to be saying: happy, contented and just
passing through.
During the late 1990s, the process of turning the service sector into a low-wage ghetto advanced
rapidly in Germany. The German unemployment rate reached 12.6 percent in 1998, primarily
because the economy could not absorb the massive layoffs in the manufacturing sector that
occurred after reunification - four out of five East German factory jobs were lost. To make up for
the shortfall, the service sector was touted by the business press and the political right wing as the
economic panacea. There was just one catch: before the mall could step in to save the German
economy, the minimum wage would have to be substantially lowered and benefits such as long
holidays for all workers would have to be dismantled. In other words, good jobs with security and a
living wage would have to be turned into bad jobs. Then Germany too would enjoy the benefits of a
service-based economic recovery.

It is one of the paradoxes of service-sector employment that the more prominent a role it plays in
the labour landscape, the more casual service-sector companies became in their attitude toward
providing job security. Nowhere is this more in evidence than in the industry's increasing reliance
on part-timers. Starbucks, for instance, staffs its outlets almost exclusively with part-timers while
only one-third of Kmart's workforce is full-time. Workers at the ill-fated Montreal-area McDonald's
cited as their principal reason for unionization the fact that they often couldn't get shifts longer than
three hours.
In the U.S. the number of part-timers has tripled since 1968, while in Canada, between 1975 and
1997, the growth rate of part-time jobs was nearly three times the rate of full-time jobs. But the
problem is not the part-time nature of work per se. In Canada, only one-third of part-timers want
but cannot find full-time jobs (which is an increase from one-fifth in the late eighties). In the U.S.,
only one-quarter want full-time jobs but can't find them. The vast majority of part-timers are
students and women, many of whom are juggling childcare and paid work. But while many workers
are indeed drawn to flexible work arrangements, their definition of what constitutes "flexibility" is
dramatically different from the one favoured by service-sector bosses. For instance, while studies
have shown that working mothers define flexibility as "having the ability to work less than fulltime hours at decent wages and benefits, while still working a regular schedule," the service sector
has a different view of part-time work, and a different agenda. A handful of brand-name chains,
including Starbucks and Borders, bolster low wages by offering health and dental benefits to their
part-timers. For other employers, however, part-time positions are used as a loophole to keep wages
down and to avoid benefits and overtime; "flexibility" becomes a code for "no promises," making
the juggling of other commitments —both financial and parental — more challenging, not less. At
some retail outlets I've researched, the allotment of hours is so random that the ritual of posting
next week's schedule prompts the staff to gather around anxiously, craning their necks and hopping
up and down as if they are checking to see who got the lead in the high-school musical.
Furthermore, the "part-time" classification is often more a technicality than a reality, with retail
employers keeping their part-timers just below the forty-hour legal cutoff for full-time —Laurie
Bonang, for instance, clocks between thirty-five and thirty-nine hours a week at Starbucks. For all
intents and purposes, she has the duties of a full-time employee, but under forty hours the company
does not have to pay overtime or guarantee full-time hours. Other chains are equally creative.
Borders instituted a company-wide thirty-seven-and-a-half-hour work week for all employees, and
Wal-Mart caps its work week at thirty-three hours, defining base "full time" as twenty-eight hours.
What all of this means in the lives of workers is a scheduling roller coaster that in many ways is
more demanding than the traditional forty-hour week. For instance, the Gap —which defines fulltime as thirty hours a week —has a system of keeping clerks "on call" for certain shifts during
which time they aren't scheduled or paid to work but must be available to come in if the manager
calls. (One worker joked to me that she had to buy a beeper in case a folding crisis flared up in Gap
Kids.)
Starbucks has been the most innovative in the modern art of supple scheduling. The company has
created a software program called Star Labour that allows head office maximum control over the
schedules of its clerks down to the minute. With Star Labour, gone is anything as blunt and
imprecise as a day or evening shift. The software measures exactly when each latte is sold and by
whom, then tailor-makes shifts —often only a few hours long —to maximize coffee-selling
efficiency. As Laurie Bonang explains, "They give you an arbitrary skill number from one to nine

and they plug in when you're available, how long you've been there, when customers come in and
when we need more staff, and the computer spits out your schedule based on that." While
Starbucks' breakthrough in "just-in-time" frothing looks great on a spreadsheet, for Steve Emery it
meant hauling himself out of bed to start work at 5 a.m., only to leave at 9:30 a.m. after the
morning rush had peaked and, according to Star Labour, he was no longer working at maximum
efficiency. Wal-Mart has introduced a similar centralized scheduling system, effectively reducing
employee hours by pinning them precisely to in-store traffic. "It's done just like we order
merchandise," says Wal-Mart CEO David Glass.
The vast gulf between employee and employer definitions of "flexibility" was the central issue of
the United Parcel Service strike in the summer of 1997, the largest U.S. job action in fourteen
years. Despite profits of $1 billion in 1996, UPS had kept 58 percent of its workers classified as
part-time and was rapidly moving toward an even more "flexible" workforce. Of the 43,000 jobs
UPS had created since 1992, only 8,000 were full time. The system worked well for the courier
company, since it was able to ride the peaks and valleys of the delivery cycle that sees heavy
pickups and deliveries in the morning and evening but lulls during the day. "There's too much
downtime in between to hire full-time workers," explained UPS spokesperson Susan Rosenberg.
Building up a part-time workforce had other cost-saving benefits. Before the strike, the company
paid its part-timers roughly half the hourly wage of its full-timers for performing the same tasks.
Furthermore, the union claimed that 10,000 of the company's so-called part-timers were, like Laurie
Bonang at Starbucks, actually working between thirty-five and thirty-nine hours a week —just
under the cutoff that would require overtime pay, full benefits and the higher wage scale.
Some service-sector companies have made much of the fact that they offer stock options or "profitsharing" to low-level employees, among them Wal-Mart, which calls its clerks "sales associates";
Borders, which refers to them as "co-owners"; and Starbucks, which prefers the term "partners."
Many employees do appreciate these gestures, but others claim that while the workplace democracy
schemes sparkle on a corporate Web site, they rarely translate into much of substance. Most parttime workers at Starbucks, for instance, can't afford to buy into the employee stock-option program
since their salaries barely cover their expenses. And where profit-sharing schemes are automatic, as
at Wal-Mart, workers say their "share" of the $118 billion of annual sales their company hauls in is
laughable. Clerks in the Windsor, Ontario, outlet of Wal-Mart, for example, say they only saw an
extra $70 during the first three years that their store was open. "Never mind that from the viewpoint
of the boardroom, the pension plan's best feature was that it kept 28 million more shares in firm
control of company executives," writes The Wall Street Journal's Bob Ortega of the Wal-Mart plan.
"Most workers perceived that they could cash in, so the cost of the plan paid off in spades by
helping keep the unions out and the wages low".

One thing you can say about the retail and service industries: at least they pay their workers a little
something for their trouble. Not so for some other industries that have liberated themselves from
the chains of social-security forms with such free-market gusto that many young workers receive no
pay from them at all. Perhaps predictably, the culture industry has led the way in the blossoming of
unpaid work, blithely turning a blind eye to the unglamorous fact that many people under thirty are
saddled with the mundane responsibility of actually having to support themselves.

Writing about his former job, which involved hiring unpaid interns to send faxes and run errands
for Men's Journal magazine, Jim Frederick notes that many of his applicants had already worked for
nothing at Interview, CBS Mews, MTV, The Village Voice and so on. "'Very impressive,' I would
say. By my quick calculations they had contributed, conservatively, five or six thousand dollars'
worth of uncompensated work to various media conglomerates." Of course, the media
conglomerates — the broadcasters, magazines and book publishers — insist that they are
generously offering young people precious experience in a hard employment market — a foot in the
door on the old-fashioned "apprenticeship" model. Besides, they say, sounding suspiciously like
McDonald's managers the world over, the interns are just kids — they don't really need the money.
And getting two "unreal" jobs for the price of one, most interns subsidize their unpaid day job by
working in the service industry at night and on weekends, as well as by living at home to a later
age. But in the U.S. — where it has become commonplace to hop from one unpaid culture job to
the next for a year or two — a disproportionate number of interns, as Frederick observes, appear to
be living off trust funds, seemingly without any immediate concerns about earning a living. But just
as the service-sector employers will not admit that the youthfulness of their workforce might have
something to do with the wages they pay and the security they fail to offer, you will never catch a
television network or a publisher confessing that the absence of remuneration for internships might
also have something to do with the relative privilege of those applying for these positions at their
companies. This racket is not only exploitative in the classic sense, it also has some very real
implications for the future of cultural production: today's interns are tomorrow's managers,
producers and editors and, as Frederick writes, "If you can't get a job unless you've had an
internship, and you can't take an internship unless you can get supported by daddy for a couple of
months, then the system guarantees an applicant pool that is decidedly privileged."
Music video stations such as MTV have been among the more liberal users of the unpaid internship
system. When it was first introduced, the music video channel represented a managerial coup in
low-cost, high-profit broadcasting since the stations primarily play videos that are produced out of
house and supplied by record labels. While some stations, including Canada's MuchMusic, now
play licensing and royalty fees to broadcast videos, these pale in comparison to the production costs
of the videos in a single top 30 countdown. Inside the stations, on air-hosts, producers and
technicians work alongside unpaid, mostly student, interns who sometimes are rewarded with jobs
and sometimes stay at the station for many months, hoping for their big break. Which is where the
legendary success stories come in - the famous VJ. who started off answering phones, or the
greatest success story of them all: the tale of Rick the Temp. In 1996, Rick won the annual "Be a
Temp at MuchMusic Contest" and was welcomed to the station with cross promotional fanfare and
branded giveaways. One year later, Rick was on the air in his new job as VJ., but the kicker was
that even after he became a big star, he kept the moniker Rick the Temp. There was Rick on TV,
interviewing the Backstreet Boys, and although he was always paid for his work, for would-be
interns, his success served a daily advertisement for the glory and glamour that waits if you donate
your labour as a gift to a major media company.

Rick the Temp isn't just the Great White Hope for unpaid interns. He also represents the pinnacle of
another subcategory of New Age workers: the temps. And temps, it must be said, need all the hope

they can get. The use of temp labour in the U.S. has increased by 400 percent since 1982 and that
growth has been steady. Annual industry revenue among American temp firms has increased by
about 20 percent every year since 1992, with the firms pulling in revenues of $58.7 billion in 1998.
The mammoth international temp agency Manpower Temporary Services rivals Wal-Mart as the
largest private employer in the U.S. According to a 1997 study, 83 percent of the fastest-growing
American companies are now outsourcing jobs they once hired people to perform — compared
with 64 percent just three years before. In Canada, the Association of Canadian Search,
Employment & Staffing Services estimates that more than 75 percent of businesses use the services
of the $2 billion Canadian temp industry.
The most dramatic growth, however, is taking place not in North America but in Western Europe,
where temp agencies are among Europe's fastest-growing companies. In France, Spain, the
Netherlands and Germany, hiring workers on long-term temporary contracts has become a welltrampled back entranceway to the labour market, allowing employers to sidestep tough laws that
provide generous employee benefits and make firing without just cause far more difficult than in
the United States. France, for instance, has become the second-largest temp-services market after
the U.S., making up 30 percent of worldwide temp revenue. And though temping accounts for only
2 percent of all the country's jobs, according to France's labour minister, Martine Aubry, "86
percent of new hires are on short-term contracts." Manpower Europe, an outpost of the U.S.-based
temp firm, saw its revenue in Spain jump a staggering 719 percent in just one year, from $6.1
million in 1996 to $50 million in 1997. Italy didn't legalize temp agencies until 1997, but when it
did, Manpower Europe rushed in to open thirty-five offices in 1998.
These companies all have the formula. They don’t take you on full time. They don’t pay benfits. Then their profits go
through the roof. – Laura Pisciotti, UPS worker, on strike, August 1997

Every day, 4.5 million workers are assigned to jobs through temp agencies in Europe and the U.S.,
but since only 12.5 percent of temps are placed on any given day, the real number of total
temporary employees in Europe and the U.S. is closer to 36 million people. More significant than
soaring numbers, however, is a major shift under way in the nature of the temporary work industry.
Temp agencies are no longer strictly in the business of farming out rent-a-receptionists when the
secretary calls in sick. For starters, temps are no longer all that temporary: in the U.S., 29 percent
stay at the same posting for a year or more. Their agencies, meanwhile, have become full-service
human resource departments for all your no-commitment staffing needs, including accounting,
filing, manufacturing and computer services. And according to Bruce Steinberg, director of
research at the U.S.-based National Association of Temporary and Staffing Services, "a quiet
evolution is taking place throughout the staffing services industry" — rather than renting out
workers, the agencies are "providing a complete service solution." What that means is that more
companies are contracting out entire functions and divisions —work previously performed in-house
—to outside agencies charged not only with staffing but, like the contract factories in the export
processing zones, administration and maintenance of the task as well. For instance, in 1993
American Airlines outsourced the ticket counters at twenty-eight U.S. airports to outside agencies.
Around 550 ticketing-agent jobs went temp and, in some cases, workers who had earned $40,000
were offered their same jobs back for $16,000. A similar reshuffling took place when UPS decided
to turn over its customer-service centres to outside contractors — 5,000 employees earning $10 to
$12 an hour were replaced with temps earning between $6.50 and $8.40

As Tom Peters says, "You're a damn fool if you own it!" Bruce Steinberg concurs: by amputating
whole divisions and sloughing them off on "managed services arrangements, the business can
concentrate its time, energy and resources on core business while staffing service practices its core
competency of managing workers." Hiring and managing workers, in other words, is not the base of
a healthy company but a specialized task — somebody else's "core competency" that is better left to
the experts, while the real business is tended to by an ever-shrinking number of workers, as the next
chapter will show.

Any discussion of the plight of corporate temps, UPS couriers, outsourced GM workers, Gap
greeters, MTV interns and Starbucks "baristas" leads inevitably to the same place: Yes, but... what
about all the great new jobs in the growing high-tech world? For my generation of workers, the
legendary riches awaiting technology workers in Seattle and Silicon Valley are the "yes, but"
answer to any and all grievances about employment exclusions. Standing in contrast to all the
downer stories about layoffs and McJobs is this shimmering digital Mecca where fifteen-year-olds
design video games for Sega, where AT&T hires hackers just to keep an eye on them and where
scores of young workers become millionaires from their lavish stock options. Yes, but...Bill Gates
will make it all okay, won't he?
It was Microsoft, with its famous employee stock-option plan, that developed and fostered the
mythology of Silicon Gold, but it is also Microsoft that has done the most to dismantle it. The
golden era of the geeks has come and gone, and today's high-tech jobs are as unstable as any other.
Part-timers, temps and contractors are rampant in Silicon Valley — a recent labour study of the
region estimates that between 27 and 40 percent of the Valley's employees are "contingency
workers," and the use of temps there is increasing at twice the rate of the rest of the country. The
percentage of Silicon Valley workers employed by temp agencies is nearly three times the national
average.
And Microsoft, the largest of the software firms, didn't just lead the way to this part-time promised
land, it wrote the operating manual. For more than a decade, the company has been busily closing
ranks around the programmers who got there first, and banishing as many other employees as it can
from that sacred inner circle. Through extensive use of independent contractors, temps and "fullservice employment solutions" Microsoft is well on its way to engineering the perfect employeeless corporation, a jigsaw puzzle of outsourced divisions, contract factories and freelance
employees. Gates has already converted one-third of his general workforce into temps, and in the
Interactive Media Division, where CD-ROMs and Internet products are developed, about half the
workers are officially employed by outside "payroll agencies," who deliver tax-free workers like
printer cartridges.
Microsoft's two-tier workforce is a microcosm of the job market's New Age new deal. At the centre
is the high-tech dream: permanent, full-time employees, with benefits and generous stock options,
working and playing on the youthful corporate "campus." These Microserfs are cultishly loyal to
their corporation, its soaring stock price and its staggering 51 percent operating profit margin

("Show me the money!" they roared at the annual staff meeting in Seattle's Kingdome Stadium in
fall 1997). And why shouldn't they be loyal? They earn an average of $220,000 a year, and that's
not even factoring in the top five superrich executives.
Orbiting around this starry-eyed core are between 4,000 and 5,750 temporary workers. The temps
work side by side with members of the core group —as technicians, designers and programmers —
and perform many of the same jobs. About 1,500 have been with the company for so long they have
taken to calling themselves "permatemps." The only way to tell the temps from the "real"
Microserfs is by the colour of their badges: blue for perms, orange for permatemps.
Like the fleet of part-timers who give UPS the "flexibility" to employ workers only during peak
hours, and the contract workers in Cavite who provide their factory owners with the "flexibility" to
send them home during dry spells, what thousands of temps means for Microsoft is the freedom to
expand and contract its workforce at will. "We use them," says Microsoft personnel officer Doug
McKenna, "to provide us with flexibility and to deal with uncertainty."
Trouble began in 1990 when the Internal Revenue Service challenged Microsoft's classification of
orange badges as independent contractors, ruling that these people were actually employees of
Microsoft and the company should be paying their payroll tax. Based in part on this finding, in
1993 a group of employees classified by Microsoft as contractors launched a lawsuit against the
company, claiming they were regular workers and deserved the same benefits and stock options as
their permanent colleagues. In July 1997, Microsoft lost the landmark case when an eleven-judge
Court of Appeals panel ruled that the freelancers were "common law" employees and had the right
to the company's benefits program, to its pension and to its stock-purchasing plan.
Microsoft's response to this setback, however, has not been to add freelancers to its payroll but
simply to work more assiduously to marginalize the temps. To this end, the company has moved
away from hiring "independent contractors" directly. Instead, after employees have been scouted,
interviewed and selected by Microsoft, they are instructed to register with one of five payroll
agencies that have special arrangements with the company. MicroTemps are then hired through an
agency that acts as the official employer: cutting pay checks, withholding income taxes and
sometimes providing bare-bones benefits. Laird Post, a principal with management consultant
Towers Pen-in in Seattle, Washington, explains the legalities of this new arrangement. "It's hard to
rationalize legally that the person is not an employee unless they are an employee of someone else"
— in Microsoft's case, that someone else is the payroll agency. To make sure that the temps will
never again be confused with actual Microsoft workers, they are barred from all extracurricular
company functions, including taking part in late-night pizza meals and after-hours parties. And in
June 1998 the company introduced a new policy requiring temps who have been on an assignment
with the company for a year or more to take a thirty-one-day break before they can take another
"temporary" post. As Sharon Decker, Microsoft's director of contingency staffing, explains, "We
are refocusing a lot of policies we had in place so everyone understands how a temp should be
treated and what is appropriate."
In addition to staffing its campus with permatemps, in 1997 Microsoft initiated a series of moves to
disentangle itself from other earthly and cumbersome aspects of running a multibillion-dollar
company. "Don't get caught with useless fixed assets," Bob Herbold, Microsoft's chief operating
officer, says, explaining his staffing philosophy to a group of shareholders. According to Herbold,

pretty much everything but the core functions of programming and product development fall into
the "useless fixed assets" category — including the company's sixty-three receptionists, who were
laid off, losing benefits and stock options, and told to reapply through the Tascor temp agency. "We
were overpaying them," Herbold said.
In the same stroke, Microsoft sliced and diced its Redmond campus and parcelled out the pieces
(along with employees who wanted to hold on to their jobs) to outside "vendors": Pitney Bowes
took over the mail room; the print and copy centre is now operated by Xerox personnel; the CDROM factory was sold to KAO Information Systems; even the company store was outsourced to
Benussen Deutsch ft Associates. In this latest round of restructuring, 680 jobs were cut from the
payroll and $500 million slashed from the operating budget. With all these contractors on the
campus, Herbold noted, "just managing the outsourcers is quite a task" —and there was no reason
for Microsoft to get saddled with that useless fixed asset. In a stroke of divestment genius,
Microsoft contracted out the task of managing the contractors to Johnson Controls, which also takes
care of the campus facilities. "Our revenue has gone up 91 percent and our head count has actually
decreased 19 percent," Bob Herbold says proudly. And what did Microsoft do with the savings?
"We're plowing them into R&D and we're plowing them into profit, obviously."

It must be said that many of Microsoft's high-tech freelancers are hardly defenceless victims of Bill
Gates's payroll concoctions, but are freelancers by choice. Like many contractors, the "software
gypsies," as high-tech freelancers are sometimes called, have made a conscious decision to put
independence and mobility before institutional loyalty and security. Some of them are even what
Tom Peters likes to call a "Brand Called You."
Tom Peters's latest management-guru idea is that just as companies must reach branding nirvana by
learning to let go of manufacturing and employment, so must individual workers empower
themselves by abandoning the idea of being employees. According to this logic, if we are to be
successful in the new economy, all of us must self-incorporate into our very own brand — a Brand
Called You. Success in the job market will only come when we retrofit ourselves as consultants and
service providers, identify our own Brand You equities and lease ourselves out to targeted projects
that will in turn increase our individual portfolio of "braggables." "I call the approach Me Inc.,"
Peters writes. "You're Chairperson/CEO/Entrepreneur-in-Chief of your own professional service
firm." Faith Popcorn, the management guru who came to prominence with her 1991 best-seller, The
Popcorn Report, goes so far as to recommend that we change our names to better "click" with our
carefully designed and marketed brand image. She did — her name used to be Faith Plotkin.
Even more than Popcorn or Peters, however, it is a man named Daniel H. Pink who is the dean at
Brand You U. Pink has seen the growth in temporary and contract work, as well as the rise in selfemployment, and has declared the arrival of "Free Agent Nation." Not only is he writing a book by
that title, but Pink himself is a proud patriot of the nation. After quitting a prestigious White House
job as Al Gore's chief speechwriter, Pink went on a journey in search of fellow "free agents":
people who had chosen a life of contracts and freelance gigs over bosses and benefits. What he
found, as he relayed in a cover article in Fast Company, was the sixties. The citizens of Pink's
nation are marketing consultants, head-hunters, copywriters and software designers who are all
striving to achieve a Zen-like balance of work and personal life. They practice their yoga positions

and play with their dogs in their wired home offices, while earning more money —by jumping from
one contract to the next — than they did when they were tied to one company and paid a fixed
salary. "This is the summer of love revisited, man!" we hear from Bo Rinald, an agent representing
a thousand freelance software developers in Silicon Valley. For Pink's free agents, the end of jobs is
the baby-boomer dream come true: free-market capitalism without neckties; dropped out of the
corporate world in body but plugged-in in spirit. Everyone knows that you can't be a cog in the
machine if you work from your living room....
A younger —and, of course, hipper —version of Free Agent Nation was articulated in a special
work issue of Details magazine. For Gen-Xers with MBAs, the future of work is apparently filled
with stunningly profitable snowboarding businesses, video-game companies and cool-hunting
firms. "Opportunity Rocks!" crowed the headline of an article that laid out the future of work as a
non-stop party of extreme self-employment: "Life without jobs, work without bosses, money
without salaries, lives without limits." According to the writer, Rob Lieber, "The time of
considering yourself an 'employee' has passed. Now it's time to start thinking of yourself as a
service provider, hiring out your skills and services to the highest, or most interesting, bidder."
I admit to being lured by the sirens of free agency myself. About four years ago, I quit my job as a
magazine editor to go freelance, and like Pink I've never looked back. Of course I love the fact that
no one boss controls my every working hour (that privilege is now spread around to dozens of
people), that I'm not subject to the arbitrary edicts of petty managers and, most important, that I can
work in my pajamas if I feel like it. I know from firsthand experience that freelance life can indeed
mean freedom, just as part time, for others, can live up to its promise of genuine flexibility. Pink
has a point when he says of free agency, "This is a legitimate way to work - it isn't some poor laidoff slob struggling to find his way back to the corporate bosom." However, there's a problem when
it's people like Pink — or other freelance writers overly euphoric about working in their pajamas —
who hold themselves up as living proof that divestment from corporate employment is a win-win
formula. And it does seem as if most of the major articles about the joys of freelancing have been
written by successful freelance writers under the impression that they themselves represent the
millions of contractors, temps, freelancers, part-timers and the self-employed. But writing, because
of its solitary nature and low overhead, is one of the very few professions that are genuinely
compatible with homework, and study after study shows that it is absurd to equate the experience of
being a freelance journalist, or having your own advertising company, with that of being a temp
secretary at Microsoft or a contract factory worker in Cavite. On the whole, casualization pans out
as the worst of both worlds: monotonous work at lower wages, with no benefits or security, and
even less control over scheduling.
The bottom line is that the advantages and drawbacks of contract and contingency work have a
simple correlation to the class of the individuals doing the work: the higher up they are on the
income scale, the more chance they have to leverage their comings and goings. The further down
they are, the more vulnerable they are to being yanked around and bargained even lower. The top
20 percent of wage earners tend to more or less maintain their high wages whether they are in fulltime jobs or on freelance contracts. But according to a 1997 U.S. study, 52 percent of women in
non-standard work arrangements are being paid "poverty-level wages" - compared with only 27.6
percent in the full-time female worker population being paid those low wages. In other words, most
non-standard workers aren't members of Free Agent Nation. According to the study, "58.2 per cent
are in the lowest quality work arrangements-jobs with substantial pay penalties and few benefits

relative to full-time standard workers." Furthermore, the real wages of temp workers in the U.S.
actually went down, on average, by 14.7 percent between 1989 and 1994.w In Canada,
nonpermanent jobs pay one-third less than permanent jobs, and 30 percent of nonpermanent
employees work irregular hours.' Clearly, temping puts the most vulnerable workforce further at
risk, and no matter what Details says, it doesn't rock.
Moreover, there is a direct cause-and-effect relationship between the free agents skipping and
hopping on the top rungs of the corporate ladder, and the agents hanging off the bottom who have
been "freed" of such pesky burdens as security and benefits. Nobody is more liberated, after all,
than the CFOs themselves, who, like Mike's cabal of uber-athletes, have formed their own Dream
Team to be traded back and forth between companies whenever some star power is needed to boost
Wall Street morale. Temp CFOs. as writer Clive Thompson calls them, now shuttle from
multinational to multinational, staying for an average term of only five years, collecting
multimillion-dollar incentive packages on the way in, and multimillion-dollar golden handshakes
on the way out." "Companies are changing executives like baseball managers," says John
Challenger, executive vice president of the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. "The
replacement will typically arrive like a SWAT team and sweep out the old and restaff with his or
her own people."()S When "Chainsaw" Al Dunlap was appointed CEO of Sunbeam in July 1996,
Scott Graham, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co., commented, "This is like the Lakers signing
Shaquille O'Neal."
The two extreme poles of workplace transience- represented by the contractor in Cavite afraid of
flying factories, and the temp CFO unveiling restructuring plans in New York —work together like
a global seesaw. Since the CFO superstars earn their reputation on Wall Street through such
kamikaze missions as auctioning off their company's entire manufacturing base or initiating a
grandiose merger that will save millions of dollars in job duplication, the more mobile the CFOs
become, the more unstable the position of the broader workforce will be. As Daniel Pink points out,
the word "freelance" is derived from the age when mercenary soldiers rented themselves — and
their lances —out for battle. "The free lancers roamed from assignment to assignment— killing
people for money." Granted it's a little dramatic, but it's not a half-bad job description for today's
free-agent executives. In fact, it is the precise reason CEO salaries skyrocketed during the years that
layoffs were at their most ruthless. Ira T. Kay, author of CEO Pay and Shareholder Value, knows
why. Writing in The Wall Street Journal, Kay points out that the exorbitant salaries American
companies have taken to paying their CEOs is a "crucial factor making the U.S. economy the most
competitive in the world" because without juicy bonuses company heads would have "no economic
incentive to face up to difficult management decisions, such as layoffs." In other words, as satirist
Wayne Grytting retorted, we are "supporting those executive bonuses so we can get...fired."
It's a fair enough equation, particularly in the U.S. According to the AFl-C10, "the CEOs of the 30
companies with the largest announced layoffs saw their salaries, bonuses, and long-term
compensation increase by 67.3 per cent." The man responsible for the most layoffs in 1997Eastman Kodak CEO George Fisher, who cut 20,100 jobs —received an options grant that same
year estimated to be worth $60 million. And the highest-paid man in the world in 1997 was Sanford
Wiell, who earned $230 million as head of the Travellers Group. The first thing Wiell did in 1998
was announce that Travellers would merge with Citicorp, a move that, while sending stock prices
soaring, is expected to throw thousands out of work. In the same spirit, John Smith, the General

Motors chairman implementing those 82,000 job cuts discussed in the last chapter, received a $2.54
million bonus in 1997 that was tied to the company's record earnings.
There are many others in the business community who, unlike Ira T. Kay, are appalled by the
amounts executives have been paying themselves in recent years. In Business Week, Jennifer
Reingold writes with some disgust, "Good, bad, or indifferent, virtually anyone who spent time in
the corner office of a large public company in 1997 saw his or her net worth rise by at least several
million." For Reingold, the injustice lies in the fact that CEOs are able to collect raises and bonuses
even when their company's stock price drops and shareholders take a hit. For instance, Ray Irani,
CEO of Occidental Petroleum, collected $101 million in compensation in 1997, the same year that
the company lost $390 million.
This camp of market watchers has been pushing for CEO remuneration to be directly linked to
stock performance; in other words, "You make us rich, you get a healthy cut. But if we take a hit,
then you take one too." Though this system protects stockholders from the greed of ineffective
executives, it actually puts ordinary workers at even greater risk, by creating direct incentives for
the quick and dirty layoffs that are always sure to rally stock prices and bring on the bonuses. For
instance, at Caterpillar — the model of the incentive-driven corporation — executives get paid in
stocks that have consistently been inflated by massive plant closures and worker wage rollbacks.
What is emerging out of this growing trend of tying executive pay to stock performance is a
corporate culture so damaged that workers must often be fired or short-changed for the boss to get
paid.
This last point raises the most interesting question of all, I think, about the long-term effect of the
brand-name multinationals' divestment of the jobs business. From Starbucks to Microsoft, from
Caterpillar to Citibank, the correlation between profit and job growth is in the process of being
severed. As Buzz Hargrove, president of the Canadian Auto Workers, says, "Workers can work
harder, their employers can be more successful, but-and downsizing and outsourcing are only one
example —the link between overall economic success and the guaranteed sharing in that success is
weaker than ever before." We know what this means in the short term: record profits, giddy
shareholders and no seats left in business class. But what does it mean in the slightly longer term?
What of the workers who fell off the payroll, whose bosses are voices on the phone at employment
agencies, who lost their reason to take pride in their company's good fortune? Is it possible that the
corporate sector, by fleeing from jobs, is unwittingly pouring fuel on the fire of its own opposition
movement?

BREEDING DISLOYALTY

In our manufacturing, administrative, and distribution facilities, we have a specific philosophycameras keep honest people honest.
-Leo Myers, safety and security systems engineer for Mattel, explains the company's enthusiastic
use of video surveillance on its global workforce, 1990

When I dropped out of university in 1993, I could count on the fingers of one hand the number of
my friends who had jobs. "The Recession" we repeated to one another over and over again, through
years of jobless summers, through listless decisions to slog it out in grad school, through periods of
cutbacks to our universities, through miserable stretches when parents were out of work. Just as we
would later blame El Nino for everything from droughts to floods, the Recession was an economic
bad weather system that had sucked up all the jobs as if they were Missouri trailer parks.
When the jobs disappeared, we understood that it was a result of the tough economic times that
seemed to be affecting everyone (though perhaps not everyone equally) from company presidents

facing bankruptcy to axe-wielding politicians-everybody, men and women, old and young in all
walks of life and work, right on down to me and my middle-class friends and our half-hearted job
searches. The shift from the Recession to the cutthroat global economy happened so suddenly I feel
as if I was sick that day and missed the whole thing-as with Grade 10 algebra, I will forever be
playing catch-up. All I know is that one minute we were all in the Recession together. The next, a
new strain of business leader was rising like a phoenix from the ashes-suit freshly pressed,
enthusiasm pumped - announcing the arrival of a new golden age. But as we have seen in the last
two chapters when the jobs came back (if the jobs came back), they came back changed. For the
workers in the contract factories of the export processing zones, and for the legions of temps, parttimers, contract and service-sector workers in industrialized countries, the modern employer has
begun to look like a one-night stand who has the audacity to expect monogamy after a meaningless
encounter. And many of them even got it for a while. Running scared from years of layoffs and
gloomy economic projections, most of us did swallow the rhetoric that we should be happy picking
up whatever pay stubs were scattered our way. There is mounting evidence, however, that
workplace transience is finally eroding our collective faith, not only in individual corporations but
in the very principle of trickle-down economics.
Soaring profits and growth rates, as well as the mind-boggling salaries and bonuses that CEOs of
large corporations pay themselves, have radically changed the conditions under which workers
originally came to accept lower wages and diminished security, leaving many feeling that they've
been had. Nowhere was this shift in attitude more apparent than in the public's sympathy for the
striking United Parcel Service workers in 1997. Though Americans are notorious for their lack of
sympathy for labour strikes, the plight of UPS part-timers struck a chord. Polls found that 55
percent of Americans supported the UPS workers, and only 27 percent sided with the company.
Keffo, the editor of a bitter zine for temporary workers, summed up the public sentiment: "Day
after day, [people] read and heard how great the economy is and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to
realize well, duh, if UPS is doing so well, why can't they pay their workers more, or hire part timers
as full timers, or keep their grubby fingers out of their workers' pension fund. So in a hilarious twist
of fate, all the 'good' economic news works against UPS in favour of the Teamsters."
Realizing that it had become a lightning rod for a broader malaise, UPS agreed to convert 10,000
part-time jobs to full-time jobs at twice the hourly pay, and increased pay for part-timers by 35
percent over five years. In explaining the concessions, UPS vice chairman John W. Alden said the
company never foresaw its workers becoming symbols of the rage against the New Economy. "If I
had known that it was going to go from negotiating for UPS to negotiating for part-time America,
we would've approached it differently."

As we have seen, it has only been in the past three or four years that corporations have stopped
hiding layoffs and restructuring behind the rhetoric of necessity and begun to speak openly and
unapologetically about their aversion to hiring people and, in extreme cases, their total exodus from
the employment business. Multinationals that once boasted of their role as "engines of job growth"
— and used it as leverage to extract all kinds of government support — now prefer to identify
themselves as engines of "economic growth." It's a subtle difference, but not if you happen to be
looking for work. Corporations are indeed "growing" the economy, but they are doing it, as we
have seen, through layoffs, mergers, consolidation and outsourcing—in other words, through job

debasement and job loss. And as the economy grows, the percentage of people directly employed
by the world's largest corporations is actually decreasing. Transnational corporations, which control
more than 33 percent of the world's productive assets, account for only 5 percent of the world's
direct employment. And although the total assets of the world's one hundred largest corporations
increased by 288 percent between 1990 and 1997, the number of people those corporations
employed grew by less than 9 percent during that same period of tremendous growth.
The most striking figure is the most recent: in 1998, despite the stellar performance of the U.S.
economy and despite the record low unemployment rate, U.S. corporations eliminated 677,000
permanent jobs — more job cuts than in any other year this decade. One in nine of those cuts came
in the aftermath of mergers; many others came from the manufacturing sector. As the low U.S
unemployment rate suggests, two-thirds of the companies that eliminated jobs created new ones and
laid-off workers found alternative employment relatively quickly. But what those dramatic job cuts
demonstrate is that a stable, reliable relationship between workers and their corporate employers
has little or nothing to do with either the unemployment rate or the relative health of the economy.
People are experiencing less stability even in the very best of economic times — in fact, these good
economic times may be flowing, at least in part, from that loss of stability.
Job creation as part of the corporate mission, particularly the creation of full-time, decently paid,
stable jobs, appears to have taken a back seat in many major corporations, regardless of company
profits. Rather than being one component of a healthy operation, labour is increasingly treated by
the corporate sector as an unavoidable burden, like paying income tax; or an expensive nuisance,
like not being allowed to dump toxic waste into lakes. Politicians may say that jobs are their
priority, but the stock market responds cheerfully every time mass layoffs are announced, and sinks
gloomily whenever it looks as if workers might get a raise. Whatever bizarre route we took to get
here, an unmistakable message now emanates from our free markets: good jobs are bad for
business, bad for "the economy" and should be avoided at all cost. Although this equation has
undeniably reaped record profits in the short term, it may well prove to be a strategic miscalculation
on the part of our captains of industry. By discarding their self-identification as job creators,
companies leave themselves open to a kind of backlash that can come only from a population that
knows that the smooth sailing of the economy is of little demonstrable benefit to them. According
to the 1997 report of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (U1MCTAD),
"Rising inequalities pose a serious threat of a political backlash against globalization, one that is as
likely to come from the North as well as from the South.... The 1920s and 1930s provide a stark,
and disturbing, reminder of just how quickly faith in markets and economic openness can be
overwhelmed by political events." With the effects of the Asian and Russian economic crises in full
swing, a UN report on "human development" issued the following year was even more severe:
noting the growing disparities between rich and poor, James Gustave Speth, administrator of the
United Nations Development Program, said, "The numbers are shockingly high, amid the affluence.
Progress must be more evenly distributed."
You hear this kind of talk more and more these days. Ominous warnings about a simmering
antiglobalization backlash cast a shadow over the usual euphoria of the annual gathering of
corporate and political leaders in Davos, Switzerland. The business press is littered with more
uneasy forecasts, such as the one in Business Week that noted, "The sight of bulging corporate
coffers co-existing with a continuous stagnation in Americans' living standards could become
politically untenable." And that's America, which has a record low unemployment rate. The

situation becomes even less comfortable in Canada, where unemployment is at 8.3 percent, and in
European Union countries that are stuck with an average unemployment rate of 11.5 percent. At a
speech delivered to the Business Council on National Issues, Ted Newall, chief executive officer of
Nova Corp. in Calgary, Alberta, called the fact that more than 20 percent of Canadians live below
the poverty line a "time bomb that is just waiting to go off." Indeed, a little side industry has
developed of CEOs falling over each other to proclaim themselves ethical clairvoyants: they write
books about the new "stockholder society," publicly berate their peers at luncheon addresses for
their lack of scruples and announce that the time has come for corporate leaders to address the
growing economic disparities. Trouble is, they can't agree on who is going to go first.
The fear that the poor will storm the barricades is as old as the castle moat, particularly during
periods of great economic prosperity accompanied by inequitable distribution of wealth. Bertrand
Russell writes that the Victorian elite in England were so consumed by paranoia that the working
class would revolt against their "appalling poverty" that "at the time of Peterloo many large country
houses kept artillery in readiness, lest they should be attacked by the mob. My maternal
grandfather, who died in 1869, while wandering in his mind during his last illness, heard a loud
noise in the street and thought it was the revolution breaking out, showing that at least
unconsciously, the thought of revolution had remained with him throughout long prosperous years."
A friend of mine whose family lives in India says her Punjabi aunt is so afraid of an insurrection of
her own household staff that she keeps the kitchen knives locked up, leaving the servants to chop
vegetables with sharpened sticks. It's not so different from the growing numbers of Americans
moving into gated communities because the suburbs no longer provide adequate protection from
the perceived urban threat.
Despite the widening gulf between rich and poor consistently reported by the UN and despite the
much-discussed disappearance of the middle class in the West, the attack on jobs and income levels
is probably not the most serious corporate offence we face as global citizens: it is, in theory, not
irreversible. Far worse, in the long term, are the crimes committed by corporations against the
natural environment, the food supply and indigenous peoples and cultures. Nevertheless, the
erosion of a commitment to steady employment is the single most significant factor contributing to
a climate of anti-corporate militancy and it is this that has made the markets most vulnerable to
widespread "social unrest," to quote The Wall Street Journal.™

When corporations are perceived as functioning vehicles of wealth distribution — effectively
trickling down jobs and tax revenue — they at least provide the bedrock for the often Faustian
bargains by which citizens offer loyalty to corporate priorities in exchange for a reliable pay check.
In the past, job creation served as a kind of corporate suit of armour, shielding companies from the
wrath that might otherwise have been directed their way as a result of environmental or humanrights abuses.
Nowhere was this armour more protective than in the "jobs vs. the environment" debates of the late
eighties and early nineties, when progressive movements were sharply divided, for example,
between those who supported the rights of loggers and those who wanted to protect old-growth
forests. In British Columbia, activists were people who came in by bus from the city while loggers
loyally stood by the multinational corporations that had anchored their communities for
generations. This kind of division is becoming less clear for many participants, as corporations
begin to lose their natural allies among blue-collar workers who have been disenfranchised by
callously executed layoffs, sudden mill closures and constant company threats to move offshore.
Today, it's hard to find a contented company town, where citizens do not feel they have in some
way been betrayed by the local corporate sector. And rather than dividing communities into
factions, corporations are increasingly serving as the common thread by which labour,
environmental and human-rights violations can be stitched together into a single political ideology.
After a while it becomes apparent that the unsustainable search for profits that, for example, leads
to the clear-cutting of old-growth forests is the same philosophy that devastates logging towns by

moving the mills to Indonesia. John Jordan, a British anarchist environmentalist, puts it this way:
"Transnationals are affecting democracy, work, communities, culture and the biosphere.
Inadvertently, they have helped us see the whole problem as one system, to connect every issue to
every other issue, to not look at one problem in isolation."
This simmering backlash is about more than personal grievances. Even if you happen to be one of
the lucky ones who has landed a good job and has never been laid off, everyone has heard the
warnings —if not for themselves, then for their children or their parents or their friends. We live in
a culture of job insecurity, and the messages of self-sufficiency have reached every one of us. In
North America, the back end of an eighteen-wheeler heading for Mexico, workers weeping at the
factory gate, the boarded-up windows of a hollowed-out factory town and people sleeping in
doorways and on sidewalks have been among the most powerful economic images of our time:
metaphors, seared into the collective consciousness, for an economy that consistently and
unapologetically puts profits before people.
That message has perhaps been received most vividly by the generation that came of age since the
recession hit in the early nineties. Almost without exception, they mapped out their life plan while
listening to a chorus of voices telling them to lower their expectations, to rely on no one for their
success. If they wanted a job with General Motors, Nike or General Electric, or indeed anywhere in
the corporate sector, the message was the same: count on no one. Just in case they weren't paying
attention, it was reinforced by high-school guidance counsellors holding seminars on how to
become "Me Inc.," by nightly newscasts filled with stories about how pension funds will soon be
empty and by companies like Prudential Insurance urging us all to "Be your own rock." At
university campuses across North America, orientation-week events —the time when students are
first introduced to campus life - are now sponsored by mutual-fund companies, which use the
opportunity to prod incoming students to start saving for their retirement before they've even picked
a major.
All this has had its effects. According to the bible of demographic marketing, The Yankelovich
Report, the belief in the need to be self-reliant has increased by one-third with every generation —
from the "Matures" (born 1909-1945), to "Boomers" (born 1946-1964) to "Xers" (defined loosely
and somewhat inaccurately as everyone born between 1965 and the present). "Over two-thirds of
Xers agree that, 'I have to take whatever I can get in this world because no one is going to give me
anything.' Far fewer Boomers and Matures agree —only half and one-third, respectively," the report
states." The New York advertising firm DMB&B found similar attitudes in its study of global
teens. "From a lengthy battery of attitudinal items, the one that teens most agree with worldwide is:
'It's up to me to get what I want out of life.'" Mine out of ten young Americans polled agreed with
this sentiment of total self-reliance.
This shift in attitude has translated into a serious boom for the mutual-fund industry. Young people,
it seems, are buying more RSPs than ever before. "Why is Generation X more focused on the need
to save?" wonders a reporter in Business Week. "Much of it has to do with self-reliance. They
believe they'll succeed only on their own initiative and have little confidence that either Social
Security or traditional employer pensions will be around to support them in retirement."

In fact, if you believe the business press, the only impact this spirit of self-reliance will have is the
spearheading of a new wave of cutthroat entrepreneurial initiatives as the kids who can't count on
anyone look out for Number One.
There is no question that many young people have compensated for the fact that they don't trust
politicians or corporations by adopting the social-Darwinist values of the system that engendered
their insecurity: they will be greedier, tougher, more focused. They will Just Do It. But what of
those who didn't go the MBA route, who don't want to be the next Bill Gates or Richard Branson?
Why should they stay invested in the economic goals of corporations that have so actively divested
them? What is the incentive to be loyal to a sector that has bombarded them, for their entire adult
life, with a single message: Don't count on us?
This issue is not only about unemployment per se. It would be a grave mistake to assume that any
old pay check will buy the level of loyalty and protection to which many corporations —sometimes
rightly —were once accustomed. Casual, part-time and low-wage work does not bring about the
same identification with one's employer as the lifelong contracts of yesterday. Go to any mall
fifteen minutes after the stores close and you'll see the new employment relationship in action: all
the minimum-wage clerks are lined up, their purses and backpacks open for "bag check." It's
standard practice, retail workers will tell you, for managers to search them daily for stolen goods.
And according to an annual industry survey conducted by the University of Florida's Security
Research Project, there is reason for suspicion: the study shows that employee theft accounted for
42.7 percent of the total amount of goods stolen from U.S. retailers in 1998, the highest rate ever
recorded by the survey. Starbucks clerk Steve Emery likes to quote a line he got from a sympathetic
customer: "You pay peanuts, so you get monkeys." When he told me that, it reminded me of
something I had heard only two months earlier from a group of Nike workers in Indonesia. Sitting
cross-legged in a circle at one of the dorms, they told me that, deep down, they hoped their factory
would burn to the ground. Understandably, the factory workers' sentiments were much more
extreme than the resentments expressed by McWorkers in the West —then again, the guards doing
"bag check" at the gated entrance to the Nike factory in Indonesia were armed with revolvers.
But it is in the ranks of the millions of temp workers that the true breeding grounds of the
Anticorporate backlash will most likely be found. Since most temps don't stay at one post long
enough for anyone to keep track of the value of their labour, the merit principle — once a sacred
capitalist tenet — is becoming moot. And the situation can be intensely demoralizing. "Pretty soon,
I'll run out of places to work in this city," writes Debbie Goad, a temp with twenty years of
secretarial experience. "I'm registered at fifteen temporary agencies. It's like playing the slots in
Vegas. They constantly call me, sounding like used-car salesmen. 'I know I'll get you the perfect
job soon.'"
She wrote those words in Temp Slave, a little publication out of Madison, Wisconsin, devoted to
tapping a seemingly bottomless well of worker resentment. In it, workers who have been branded
as disposable vent their anger at the corporations that rent them like pieces of equipment, then
return them, used, to the agency. Temps traditionally have had no one to talk to about these issues
— the nature of the work keeps them isolated from each other and also, inside their temporary
workplaces, from their salaried co-workers.

So it's no surprise that Temp Slave, and Web sites like Temp 24-7, boil with repressed hostility,
offering helpful tips on how to sabotage your employer's computer system, as well as essays with
titles such as "Everybody hates temps. The feeling is mutual!" and "The boredom, the sheer
boredom of office life for temps."
Just as temp workforces mess with the merit principle, so does the growing practice of swapping
CEOs like pro ballplayers. Temp CEOs are a major assault on the capitalist folklore of the mailroom boy who works his way up to becoming president of the company. Today's executives, since
they just seem to trade the top spot with one another, appear to be born into their self-enclosed
stratospheres like kings. In such a context, there is less room for the dream of making it up from the
mail room — especially since the mail room has probably been outsourced to Pitney Bowes and
staffed with permatemps.
That is the situation at Microsoft, and it is part of the reason why temp rage seethes there like
nowhere else. Another is that Microsoft openly admits that its reserve of temps exists to protect the
core of permanent workers from the ravages of the free market. When a product line is
discontinued, or costs are cut in ingenious new ways, it's the temps that absorb the blows. If you ask
the agencies, they say that their clients don't mind being treated like outdated software — after all,
Bill Gates never promised them a thing. "When people know it's a temporary arrangement, some
day, when the assignment ends, there's not a sense of a broken trust," explains Peg Cheirett,
president of Wasser Group, one of the agencies that supplies Microsoft with temps.
There's no doubt Gates has devised a means of downsizing that avoids those high-pitched wails of
betrayal that IBM bosses faced in the late eighties when they eliminated 37,000 jobs, shocking
employees who were under the impression they had secured jobs for life. Microsoft's temps have no
basis to expect anything of Bill Gates —that much is true —but while that fact may keep pickets
from blocking the entrance to the Microsoft Campus, it does little to protect the company from
getting hacked from inside its own computer system. (As it did throughout 1998, when the hacker
cabal Cult of the Dead Cow released a made-for-Microsoft hacking program called Back Orifice. It
was downloaded from the Internet 300,000 times.) Microsoft's permatemps brush up against the
hyperactive capitalist dream of Silicon Gold every day, and yet they —more than anyone else —
know that it's an invitation-only affair. So while Microsoft's permanent employees are renowned for
their corporate cultishness, Microsoft permatemps are almost unparalleled in their rancour. Asked
by journalists what they think of their employer, they offer up such choice comments as: "They
treat you like pond scum" or "It's a system of having two classes of people, and instilling fear and
inferiority and loathing."

Commenting on this shift, Charles Handy, author of The Hungry Spirit, writes that "it is clear that
the psychological contract between employers and employed has changed. The smart jargon now
talks of guaranteeing 'employ-ability' not 'employment,' which, being interpreted, means don't count
on us, count on yourself, but we'll try to help if we can."

But for some — particularly younger workers — there is a silver lining. Because young people tend
not to see the place where they work as an extension of their souls, they have, in some cases, found
freedom in knowing they will never suffer the kind of heart-wrenching betrayals their parents did.
For almost everyone who has entered the job market in the past decade, unemployment is a known
quantity, as is self-generated and erratic work. In addition, losing one's job is much less frightening
when getting it seemed an accident in the first place. Such familiarity with unemployment creates
its own kind of worker divestment — divestment of the very notion of total dependency on stable
work. We may begin to wonder whether we should even want the same job for our whole lives,
and, more important, why we should depend on the twists and turns of large institutions for our
sense of self.
This slow divestment by corporate culture has implications that reach far beyond the psychology of
the individual: a population of skilled workers who don't see themselves as corporate lifers could
lead to a renaissance in creativity and a revitalization of civic life, two very hopeful prospects. One
thing is certain: it is already leading to a new kind of Anticorporate politics.
[Taking the U.S. statistics as an example: the unemployed, part-time, temporary and replacement
workers make up close to 40 percent of people actively working or looking for work. However, if
you factor in the 67 million working-age Americans who are not included in the unemployment
figures because they are not actively looking for work, the percentage of adults holding down fulltime permanent jobs slips into the minority.]
You can see it in the political computer hackers who go after Microsoft and, as the next chapter will
show, in the guerrilla "adbusters" who target urban billboards. It is there as well in anarchic pranks
like "Phone in Sick to Work Day," the "Steal from Work! Because Work Is Stealing from You!"
manifesto and on Web sites with names like Corporate America Sucks, just as it underlies
international Anticorporate campaigns like the one against McDonald's spurred by the McLibel
Trial, and the one against Nike, focusing on Asian factory conditions.

In his essay "Stupid Jobs Are Good to Relax With," Toronto writer Hal Niedzviecki contrasts the
detachment he feels from the steady stream of "joke jobs" that junk up his resume with his father's
profound dislocation at being forced into early retirement after a career of steady upward mobility.
Hal helped his father pack up his desk on his last day at the office, watching as he nicked Post-it
Notes and other office supplies from the company that had employed him for twelve years.
"Despite his decades of labour and my years of being barely employed (and the five degrees we
have between us), we have both ended up in the same place. He feels cheated. I don't."

Members of the sixties youth culture vowed to be the first generation not to "sell out": they just
wouldn't buy a ticket for the express train with the sign reading "lifelong employment." But in the
ranks of young part-timers, temps and contract workers, we are witnessing something potentially
far more powerful. We are seeing the first wave of workers who never bought in — some of them
by choice, but most because that lifelong-employment train has spent most of the past decade
standing in the station.
The extent of this shift cannot be overstated. Among the total number of working-age adults in the
U.S., Canada and the U.K., those with full-time, permanent jobs working for someone other than
themselves are in the minority. Temps, part-timers, the unemployed and those who have opted out
of the labour force entirely — some because they don't want to work but many more because they
have given up looking for jobs — now make up more than half of the working-age population.
In other words, the people who don't have access to a corporation to which they can offer lifelong
loyalty are the majority. And for young workers, consistently overrepresented among the
unemployed, part-time and temporary sectors, the relationship to the work world is even more
tenuous.

It should come as no surprise that the companies that increasingly find themselves at the wrong end
of a bottle of spray paint, a computer hack or an international Anticorporate campaign are the ones
with the most cutting-edge ads, the most intuitive market researchers and the most aggressive inschool outreach programs. With the dictates of branding forcing companies to sever their traditional
ties to steady job creation, it is no exaggeration to say that the "strongest" brands are the ones
generating the worst jobs, whether in the export processing zones, in Silicon Valley or at the mall.
Furthermore, the companies that advertise aggressively on MTV, Channel One and in Details,
selling sneakers, jeans, fast food and Walkmans, are the very ones that pioneered the McJob sector
and led the production exodus to cheap labour enclaves like Cavite. After pumping young people
up with go-get-'em messages — the "Just Do It" sneakers, "No Fear" T-shirts and "No Excuses"
jeans — these companies have responded to job requests with a resounding "Who, me?" The
workers in Cavite may be unswooshworthy, but Nike's and Levi's core consumers have received
another message from the brands' global shuffle: they are unjobworthy.
To add insult to injury, as we saw in Part 1, "No Space," this abandonment by brand-name
corporations is occurring at the very moment when youth culture is being sought out for more
aggressive branding than ever before. Youth style and attitude are among the most effective wealth
generators in our entertainment economy, but real live youth are being used around the world to
pioneer a new kind of disposable workforce. It is in this volatile context, as the final section will
show, that the branding economy is becoming the political equivalent of a sign hanging on the back
of the body corporate that says "Kick Me."

CHAPTER TWELVE
CULTURE JAMMING

ªknÂ¨dk?_ZgFgFj+w
Advertising men are indeed very unhappy these days, very nervous, with a kind of apocalyptic
expectancy. Often when I have lunched with an agency friend, a half dozen worried copy writers
and art directors have accompanied us. Invariably they want to know when the revolution is
coming, and where will they get off if it does come.
— Ex-adman James Rorty, Our Master's Voice, 1934

It's Sunday morning on the edge of New York's Alphabet City and Jorge Rodriguez de Gerada is
perched at the top of a high ladder, ripping the paper off a cigarette billboard. Moments before, the
billboard at the corner of Houston and Attorney sported a fun-loving Newport couple jostling over
a pretzel. Now it showcases the haunting face of a child, which Rodriguez de Gerada has painted in

rust. To finish it off, he pastes up a few hand-torn strips of the old Newport ad, which form a
fluorescent green frame around the child's face.
When it's done, the installation looks as the thirty-one-year-old artist had intended: as if years of
cigarette, beer and car ads had been scraped away to reveal the rusted backing of the billboard.
Burned into the metal is the real commodity of the advertising transaction. "After the ads are taken
down," he says, "what is left is the impact on the children in the area, staring at these images."
Unlike some of the growing legion of New York guerrilla artists, Rodriguez de Gerada refuses to
slink around at night like a vandal, choosing instead to make his statements in broad daylight. For
that matter, he doesn't much like the phrase "guerrilla art," preferring "citizen art" instead. He wants
the dialogue he has been having with the city's billboards for more than ten years to be seen as a
normal mode of discourse in a democratic society-not as some edgy vanguard act. While he paints
and pastes, he wants kids to stop and watch - as they do on this sunny day, just as an old man offers
to help support the ladder.
Rodriguez de Gerada even claims to have talked cops out of arresting him on three different
occasions. "I say, 'Look, look what's around here, look what's happening. Let me explain to you
why I do it.'" He tells the police officer about how poor neighbourhoods have a disproportionately
high number of billboards selling tobacco and hard liquor products. He talks about how these ads
always feature models sailing, skiing or playing golf, making the addictive products they promote
particularly glamorous to kids stuck in the ghetto, longing for escape. Unlike the advertisers who
pitch and run, he wants his work to be part of a community discussion about the politics of public
space.
Rodriguez de Gerada is widely recognized as one of the most skilled and creative founders of
culture jamming, the practice of parodying advertisements and hijacking billboards in order to
drastically alter their messages. Streets are public spaces, adbusters argue, and since most residents
can't afford to counter corporate messages by purchasing their own ads, they should have the right
to talk back to images they never asked to see. In recent years, this argument has been bolstered by
advertising's mounting aggressiveness in the public domain — the ads discussed in "No Space,"
painted and projected onto sidewalks; reaching around entire buildings and buses; into schools;
onto basketball courts and on the Internet. At the same time, as discussed in "No Choice," the
proliferation of the quasi-public "town squares" of malls and superstores has created more and more
spaces where commercial messages are the only ones permitted. Adding even greater urgency to
their cause is the belief among many jammers that concentration of media ownership has
successfully devalued the right to free speech by severing it from the right to be heard.
All at once, these forces are coalescing to create a climate of semiotic Robin Hoodism. A growing
number of activists believe the time has come for the public to stop asking that some space be left
unsponsored, and to begin seizing it back. Culture jamming baldly rejects the idea that marketing
— because it buys its way into our public spaces — must be passively accepted as a one-way
information flow.
The most sophisticated culture jams are not stand-alone ad parodies but interceptions — countermessages that hack into a corporation's own method of communication to send a message starkly at

odds with the one that was intended. The process forces the company to foot the bill for its own
subversion, either literally, because the company is the one that paid for the billboard, or
figuratively, because anytime people mess with a logo, they are tapping into the vast resources
spent to make that logo meaningful. Kalle Lasn, editor of Vancouver-based Adbusters magazine,
uses the martial art of jujitsu as a precise metaphor to explain the mechanics of the jam. "In one
simple deft move you slap the giant on its back. We use the momentum of the enemy." It's an
image borrowed from Saul Alinsky who, in his activist bible, Rules for Radicals, defines "mass
political jujitsu" as "utilizing the power of one part of the power structure against another part...the
superior strength of the Haves become their own undoing." So, by rappelling off the side of a thirtyby-ninety-foot Levi's billboard (the largest in San Francisco) and pasting the face of serial killer
Charles Manson over the image, a group of jammers attempts to leave a disruptive message about
the labour practices employed to make Levi's jeans. In the statement it left on the scene, the
Billboard Liberation Front said they chose Manson's face because the jeans were "Assembled by
prisoners in China, sold to penal institutions in the Americas."
The term "culture jamming" was coined in 1984 by the San Francisco audio-collage band
Negativland. "The skilfully reworked billboard ...directs the public viewer to a consideration of the
original corporate strategy," a band member states on the album Jamcon '84. The jujitsu metaphor
isn't as apt for jammers who insist that they aren't inverting ad messages but are rather improving,
editing, augmenting or unmasking them. "This is extreme truth in advertising," one billboard artist
tells me. A good jam, in other words, is an X-ray of the subconscious of a campaign, uncovering
not an opposite meaning but the deeper truth hiding beneath the layers of advertising euphemisms.
So, according to these principles, with a slight turn of the imagery knob, the now-retired Joe Camel
turns into Joe Chemo, hooked up to an IV machine. That's what's in his future, isn't it? Or Joe is
shown about fifteen years younger than his usual swinger self (see image, page 278). Like Baby
Smurf, the "Cancer Kid" is cute and cuddly and playing with building blocks instead of sports cars
and pool cues. And why not? Before RJ. Reynolds reached a $206 billion settlement with forty-six
states, the American government accused the tobacco company of using the cartoon camel to entice
children to start smoking — why not go further, the culture jammers ask, and reach out to even
younger would-be smokers? Apple computers' "Think Different" campaign of famous figures both
living and dead has been the subject of numerous simple hacks: a photograph of Stalin appears with
the altered slogan "Think Really Different"; the caption for the ad featuring the Dalai Lama is
changed to "Think Disillusioned" and the rainbow Apple logo is morphed into a skull (see image
on page 344). My favourite truth-in-advertising campaign is a simple jam on Exxon that appeared
just after the 1989 Valdez spill: "Shit Happens. New Exxon," two towering billboards announced to
millions of San Francisco commuters.
Attempting to pinpoint the roots of culture jamming is next to impossible, largely because the
practice is itself a cutting and pasting of graffiti, modern art, do-it-yourself punk philosophy and
age-old pranksterism. And using billboards as an activist canvas isn't a new revolutionary tactic
either. San Francisco's Billboard Liberation Front (responsible for the Exxon and Levi's jams) has
been altering ads for twenty years, while Australia's Billboard Utilizing Graffitists Against
Unhealthy Promotions (BUG-UP) reached its peak in 1983, causing an unprecedented $1 million
worth of damage to tobacco billboards in and around Sydney.
It was Guy Debord and the Situationists, the muses and theorists of the theatrical student uprising
of Paris, May 1968, who first articulated the power of a simple detournement, defined as an image,

message or artefact lifted out of its context to create a new meaning. But though culture jammers
borrow liberally from the avant-garde art movements of the past — from Dada and Surrealism to
Conceptualism and Situationism — the canvas these art revolutionaries were attacking tended to be
the art world and its passive culture of spectatorship, as well as the anti-pleasure ethos of
mainstream capitalist society. For many French students in the late sixties, the enemy was the
rigidity and conformity of the Company Man; the company itself proved markedly less engaging.
So where Situationist Asger Jorn hurled paint at pastoral paintings bought at flea markets, today's
culture jammers prefer to hack into corporate advertising and other avenues of corporate speech.
And if the culture jammers' messages are more pointedly political than their predecessors', that may
be because what were indeed subversive messages in the sixties — "Never Work," "It Is Forbidden
to Forbid," "Take Your Desires for Reality" —now sound more like Sprite or Nike slogans: Just
Feel It. And the "situations" or "happenings" staged by the political pranksters in 1968, though
genuinely shocking and disruptive at the time, are the Absolut Vodka ad of 1998 —the one
featuring purple-clad art school students storming bars and restaurants banging on bottles.
In 1993, Mark Dery wrote "Culture Jamming: Hacking, Slashing and Sniping in the Empire of
Signs," a booklet published by the Open Magazine Pamphlet Series. For Dery, jamming
incorporates such eclectic combinations of theatre and activism as the Guerrilla Girls, who
highlighted the art world's exclusion of female artists by holding demonstrations outside the
Whitney Museum in gorilla masks; Joey Skagg, who has pulled off countless successful media
hoaxes; and Artfux's execution-in-effigy of arch-Republican Jesse Helms on Capitol Hill. For Dery,
culture jamming is anything, essentially, that mixes art, media, parody and the outsider stance. But
within these subcultures, there has always been a tension between the forces of the merry prankster
and the hard-core revolutionary. Nagging questions re-emerge: are play and pleasure themselves
revolutionary acts, as the Situationists might argue? Is screwing up the culture's information flows
inherently subversive, as Skagg would hold? Or is the mix of art and politics just a matter of
making sure, to paraphrase Emma Goldman, that somebody has hooked up a good sound system at
the revolution?
Though culture jamming is an undercurrent that never dries up entirely, there is no doubt that for
the last five years it has been in the midst of a revival, and one focused more on politics than on
pranksterism. For a growing number of young activists, adbusting has presented itself as the perfect
tool with which to register disapproval of the multinational corporations that have so aggressively
stalked them as shoppers, and so unceremoniously dumped them as workers. Influenced by media
theorists such as Noam Chomsky, Edward Herman, Mark Crispin Miller, Robert McChesney and
Ben Bagdikian, all of whom have explored ideas about corporate control over information flows,
the adbusters are writing theory on the streets, literally deconstructing corporate culture with a
waterproof magic marker and a bucket of wheat paste.
Jammers span a significant range of backgrounds, from purer-than-thou Marxist-anarchists who
refuse interviews with "the corporate press" to those like Rodriguez de Gerada who work in the
advertising industry by day (his paying job, ironically, is putting up commercial signs and
superstore window displays) and long to use their skills to send messages they consider
constructive. Besides a fair bit of animosity between these camps, the only ideology bridging the
spectrum of culture jamming is the belief that free speech is meaningless if the commercial
cacophony has risen to the point that no one can hear you. "I think everyone should have their own
billboard, but they don't," says Jack Napier (a pseudonym) of the Billboard Liberation Front.

On the more radical end of the spectrum, a network of "media collectives" has emerged,
decentralized and anarchic, that combine adbusting with zine publishing, pirate radio, activist
video, Internet development and community activism. Chapters of the collective have popped up in
Tallahassee, Boston, Seattle, Montreal and Winnipeg — often splintering off into other
organizations. In London, where adbusting is called "subvertising," a new group has been formed,
called the UK Subs after the seventies punk group of the same name. And in the past two years, the
real-world jammers have been joined by a global network of on-line "hacktivists" who carry out
their raids on the Internet, mostly by breaking into corporate Web sites and leaving their own
messages behind.
More mainstream groups have also been getting in on the action. The U.S. Teamsters have taken
quite a shine to the ad jam, using it to build up support for striking workers in several recent labour
disputes. For instance, Miller Brewing found itself on the receiving end of a similar jam when it
laid off workers at a St. Louis plant. The Teamsters purchased a billboard that parodied a then
current Miller campaign; as Business Week reported, "Instead of two bottles of beer in a snow bank
with the tagline 'Two Cold,' the ad showed two frozen workers in a snow bank labelled 'Too Cold:
Miller canned 88 St. Louis workers.'" As organizer Ron Carver says, "When you're doing this,
you're threatening multimillion-dollar ad campaigns."
One high-profile culture jam arrived in the fall of 1997 when the New York antitobacco lobby
purchased hundreds of rooftop taxi ads to hawk "Virginia Slime" and "Cancer Country" brand
cigarettes. All over Manhattan, as yellow cabs got stuck in gridlock, the jammed ads jostled with
the real ones.

The rebirth of culture jamming has much to do with newly accessible technologies that have made
both the creation and the circulation of ad parodies immeasurably easier. The Internet may be
bogged down with brave new forms of branding, as we have seen, but it is also crawling with sites
that offer links to culture jammers in cities across North America and Europe, ad parodies for
instant downloading and digital versions of original ads, which can be imported directly onto
personal desktops or jammed on site. For Rodriguez de Gerada, the true revolution has been in the
impact desktop publishing has had on the techniques available to ad hackers. Over the course of the
last decade, he says, culture jamming has shifted "from low-tech to medium-tech to high-tech,"
with scanners and software programs like Photoshop now enabling activists to match colours, fonts
and materials precisely. "I know so many different techniques that make it look like the whole ad
was reprinted with its new message, as opposed to somebody coming at it with a spray-paint can."
This is a crucial distinction. Where graffiti traditionally seek to leave dissonant tags on the slick
face of advertising (or the "pimple on the face of the retouched cover photo of America," to use a
Negativland image), Rodriguez de Gerada's messages are designed to mesh with their targets,
borrowing visual legitimacy from advertising itself. Many of his "edits" have been so successfully
integrated that the altered billboards look like originals, though with a message that takes viewers
by surprise. Even the child's face he put up in Alphabet City —not a traditional parody jam — was
digitally output on the same kind of adhesive vinyl that advertisers use to seamlessly cover buses
and buildings with corporate logos. "The technology allows us to use Madison Avenue's aesthetics

against itself," he says. "That is the most important aspect of this new wave of people using this
guerrilla tactic, because that's what the MTV generation has become accustomed to - everything's
flashy, everything's bright and clean. If you spend time to make it cleaner it will not be dismissed."
But others hold that jamming need not be so high tech. The Toronto performance artist Jubal
Brown spread the visual virus for Canada's largest billboard-busting blitz with nothing more than a
magic marker. He taught his friends how to distort the already hollowed out faces of fashion
models by using a marker to black out their eyes and draw a zipper over their mouths — presto!
Instant skull. For the women jammers in particular, "skulling" fitted in neatly with the "truth in
advertising" theory: if emaciation is the beauty ideal, why not go all the way with zombie chic —
give the advertisers a few supermodels from beyond the grave? For Brown, more nihilist than
feminist, skulling was simply a detournement to highlight the cultural poverty of the sponsored life.
("Buy Buy Buy! Die Die Die!" reads Brown's statement displayed in a local Toronto art gallery.)
On April Fool's Day, 1997, dozens of people went out on skulling missions, hitting hundreds of
billboards on busy Toronto streets (see image, page 344). Their handiwork was reprinted in
Adbusters, helping to spread skulling to cities across North America.
And nobody is riding the culture-jamming wave as high as Adbusters, the self-described "houseorgan" of the culture-jamming scene. Editor Kalle Lasn, who speaks exclusively in the magazine's
enviro-pop lingo, likes to say that we are a culture "addicted to toxins" that are poisoning our
bodies, our "mental environment" and our planet. He believes that adbusting will eventually spark a
"paradigm shift" in public consciousness. Published by the Vancouver-based Media Foundation,
the magazine started in 1989 with 5,000 copies. It now has a circulation of 35,000-at least 20,000
copies of which go to the United States. The foundation also produces "uncommercials" for
television that accuse the beauty industry of causing eating disorders, attack North American over
consumption, and urge everyone to trade their cars in for bikes. Most television stations in Canada
and the U.S. have refused to air the spots, which gives the Media Foundation the perfect excuse to
take them to court and use the trials to attract press attention to their vision of more democratic,
publicly accessible media.
Culture jamming is enjoying a resurgence, in part because of technological advancements, but also
more pertinently, because of the good old rules of supply and demand. Something not far from the
surface of the public psyche is delighted to see the icons of corporate power subverted and mocked.
There is, in short, a market for it. With commercialism able to overpower the traditional authority
of religion, politics and schools, corporations have emerged as the natural targets for all sorts of
free-floating rage and rebellion. The new ethos that culture jamming taps into is go-for-thecorporate-jugular. "States have fallen back and corporations have become the new institutions,"
says Jaggi Singh, a Montreal-based Anticorporate activist. "People are just reacting to the
iconography of our time." American labour rights activist Trim Bissell goes further, explaining that
the thirsty expansion of chains like Starbucks and the aggressive branding of companies like Nike
have created a climate ripe for Anticorporate attacks. "There are certain corporations which market
themselves so aggressively, which are so intent on stamping their image on everybody and every
street, that they build up a reservoir of resentment among thinking people," he says. "People resent
the destruction of culture and its replacement with these mass-produced corporate logos and
slogans. It represents a kind of cultural fascism."

Most of the superbrands are of course well aware that the very imagery that has generated billions
for them in sales is likely to create other, unintended, waves within the culture. Well before the
anti-Nike campaign began in earnest, CEO Phil Knight presciently observed that "there's a flip side
to the emotions we generate and the tremendous well of emotions we live off of. Somehow,
emotions imply their opposites and at the level we operate, the reaction is much more than a
passing thought." The reaction is also more than the fickle flight of fashion that makes a particular
style of hip sneaker suddenly look absurd, or a played-to-death pop song become, overnight,
intolerable. At its best, culture jamming homes in on the flip side of those branded emotions, and
refocuses them, so that they aren't replaced with a craving for the next fashion or pop sensation but
turn, slowly, on the process of branding itself.
It's hard to say how spooked the advertisers are about getting busted. Although the U.S. Association
of National Advertisers has no qualms about lobbying police on behalf of its members to crack
down on adbusters, they are generally loath to let the charges go to trial. This is probably wise.
Even though ad companies try to paint jammers as "vigilante censors" in the media,10 they know it
wouldn't take much for the public to decide that the advertisers are the ones censoring the jammers'
creative expressions.
So while most big brand names rush to sue for alleged trademark violations and readily take each
other to court for parodying slogans or products (as Nike did when Candies shoes adopted the
slogan "Just Screw It"), multinationals are proving markedly less eager to enter into legal battles
that will clearly be fought less on legal than on political grounds. "No one wants to be in the
limelight because they are the target of community protests or boycotts," one advertising executive
told Advertising Age." Furthermore, corporations rightly see jammers as rabid attention seekers and
have learned to avoid anything that could garner media coverage for their stunts. A case in point
came in 1992 when Absolut Vodka threatened to sue Adbusters over its "Absolut Nonsense"
parody. The company immediately backed down when the magazine went to the press and
challenged the distiller to a public debate on the harmful effects of alcohol.
And much to Negativland's surprise, Pepsi's lawyers even refrained from responding to the band's
1997 release, Dispepsi — art anti-pop album consisting of hacked, jammed, distorted and
disfigured Pepsi jingles. One song mimics the ads by juxtaposing the product's name with a laundry
list of random unpleasant images: "I got fired by my boss. Pepsi/I nailed Jesus to the cross. Pepsi/...
The ghastly stench of puppy mills. Pepsi" and so on. When asked by Entertainment Weekly
magazine for its response to the album, the soft-drink giant claimed to think it was "a pretty good
listen."

There is a connection between the ad fatigue expressed by the jammers and the fierce salvos against
media sexism, racism and homophobia that were so much in vogue when I was an undergraduate in
the late eighties and early nineties. This connection is perhaps best traced through the evolving
relationships that feminists have had with the ad world, particularly since the movement deserves
credit for laying the groundwork for many of the current ad critiques. As Susan Douglas notes in
Where the Girls Are, "Of all the social movements of the 1960s and '70s, none was more explicitly
anti-consumerist than the women's movement. Feminists had attacked the ad campaigns for
products like Pristeen and Silva Thins, and by rejecting makeup, fashion and the need for spotless

floors, repudiated the very need to buy certain products at all." Furthermore, when Ms. magazine
was relaunched in 1990, the editors took advertiser interference so seriously that they made the
unprecedented move of banishing lucrative advertisements from their pages entirely. And the "No
Comment" section — a back-page gallery of sexist ads reprinted from other publications - remains
one of the highest-profile forums for adbusting.
Many female culture jammers say they first became interested in the machinations of marketing via
a "Feminism 101" critique of the beauty industry. Maybe they started by scrawling "feed me" on
Calvin Klein ads in bus shelters, as the skateboarding members of the all-high-school Bitch Brigade
did. Or maybe they got their hands on a copy of Nomy Lamm's zine, I'm So Fucking Beautiful, or
they stumbled onto the "Feed the Super Model" interactive game on the official RiotGrrrl Web site.
Or maybe, like Toronto's Carly Stasko, they got started through grrrly self-publishing. Twenty-oneyear-old Stasko is a one-woman alternative-image factory: her pocket and backpack overflow with
ad-jammed stickers, copies of her latest zine and handwritten flyers on the virtues of "guerrilla
gardening." And when Stasko is not studying semiotics at the University of Toronto, planting
sunflower seeds in abandoned urban lots or making her own media, she's teaching courses at local
alternative schools where she shows classes of fourteen-year-olds how they too can cut and paste
their own culture jams.
Stasko's interest in marketing began when she realized the degree to which contemporary
definitions of female beauty —articulated largely through the media and advertisements —were
making her and her peers feel insecure and inadequate. But unlike my generation of young
feminists who had dealt with similar revelations largely by calling for censorship and re-education
programs, she caught the mid-nineties self-publishing craze. Still in her teens, Stasko began
publishing Uncool, a photocopied zine crammed with collages of sliced-and-diced quizzes from
women's magazines, jammed ads for tampons, manifestos on culture jamming and, in one issue, a
full-page ad for Philosophy Barbie. "What came first?" Stasko's Barbie wonders. "The beauty or the
myth?" and "If I break a nail, but I'm asleep, is it still a crisis?" She says that the process of making
her own media, adopting the voice of the promoter and hacking into the surface of the ad culture
began to weaken advertising's effect on her. "I realized that I can use the same tools the media does
to promote my ideas. It took the sting out of the media for me because I saw how easy it was."
Although he is more than ten years older than Stasko, the road that led Rodriguez de Gerada to
culture jamming shares some of the same twists. A founding member of the political art troop
Artfux, he began adbusting coincident with a wave of black and Latino community organizing
against cigarette and alcohol advertising. In 1990, thirty years after the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People first lobbied cigarette companies to use more black models in their
ads, a church-based movement began in several American cities that accused these same companies
of exploiting black poverty by target-marketing inner cities for their lethal product. In a clear sign
of the times, attention had shifted from who was in the ads to the products they sold. Reverend
Calvin 0. Butts of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem took his parishioners on billboardbusting blitzes during which they would paint over the cigarette and alcohol advertisements around
their church. Other preachers took up the fight in Chicago, Detroit and Dallas.
Reverend Butts's adbusting consisted of reaching up to offending billboards with long-handled
paint rollers and whitewashing the ads. It was functional, but Rodriguez de Gerada decided to be
more creative: to replace the companies' consumption messages with more persuasive political

messages of his own. As a skilled artist, he carefully morphed the faces of cigarette models so they
looked rancid and diseased. He replaced the standard Surgeon General's Warning with his own
messages: "Struggle General's Warning: Blacks and Latinos are the prime scapegoats for illegal
drugs, and the prime targets for legal ones."
Like many other early culture jammers, Rodriguez de Gerada soon extended his critiques beyond
tobacco and alcohol ads to include rampant ad bombardment and commercialism in general, and, in
many ways, he has the ambitiousness of branding itself to thank for this political evolution. As
inner-city kids began stabbing each other for their Nike, Polo, Hilfiger and Nautica gear, it became
clear that tobacco and alcohol companies are not the only marketers that prey on poor children's
longing for escape. As we have seen, these fashion labels sold disadvantaged kids so successfully
on their exaggerated representations of the good life-the country club, the yacht, the superstar
celebrity — that logowear has become, in some parts of the Global City, both talisman and weapon.
Meanwhile, the young feminists of Carly Stasko's generation whose sense of injustice had been
awakened by Naomi Wolfs Beauty Myth, and Jean Kilbourne's documentary Killing Us Softly, also
lived through the feeding frenzies around "alternative," Gen-X, hip-hop and rave culture. In the
process, many became vividly aware that marketing affects communities not only by stereotyping
them, but also — and equally powerfully - by hyping and chasing after them. This was a tangible
shift from one generation of feminists to the next. When Ms. went ad-free in 1990, for instance,
there was a belief that the corrosive advertising interference from which Gloria Steinem and Robin
Morgan were determined to free their publication was a specifically female problem. But as the
politics of identity mesh with the burgeoning critique of corporate power, the demand has shifted
from reforming problematic ad campaigns to questioning whether advertisers have any legitimate
right to invade every nook and cranny of our mental and physical environment: it has become about
the disappearance of space and the lack of meaningful choice. Ad culture has demonstrated its
remarkable ability to absorb, accommodate and even profit from content critiques. In this context, it
has become abundantly clear that the only attack that will actually shake this resilient industry is
one levelled not at the pretty people in the pictures, but against the corporations that paid for them.
So for Carly Stasko, marketing has become more an environmental than a gender or self-esteem
issue, and her environment is the streets, the university campus and the mass-media culture in
which she, as an urbanite, lives her life. "I mean, this is my environment," she says, "and these ads
are really directed at me. If these images can affect me, then I can affect them back."

For many students coming of age in the late nineties, the turning point from focusing on the content
of advertising to a preoccupation with the form itself occurred in the most private of places: in their
university washrooms, staring at a car ad. The washroom ads first began appearing on North
American campuses in 1997 and have been proliferating ever since. As we have already seen in
Chapter 5, the administrators who allowed ads to creep onto their campuses told themselves that
young people were already so bombarded with commercial messages that a few more wouldn't kill
them, and the revenues would help fund valuable programs. But it seems there is such a thing as an
ad that breaks the camel's back — and for many students, that was it.

The irony, of course, is that from the advertiser's perspective, niche nirvana had been attained.
Short of eyelid implants, ads in college washrooms represent as captive a youth market as there is
on earth. But from the students' perspective, there could have been no more literal metaphor for
space closing in than an ad for Pizza Pizza or Chrysler Neon staring at them from over a urinal or
from the door of a W.C. cubicle. Which is precisely why this misguided branding scheme created
the opportunity for hundreds of North American students to take their first tentative steps toward
direct Anticorporate activism.
Looking back, school officials must see that there is something hilariously misguided about putting
ads in private cubicles where students have been known to pull out their pens or eyeliners and
scrawl desperate declarations of love, circulate unsubstantiated rumours, carry on the abortion
debate and share deep philosophical insights. When the mini-billboards arrived, the bathroom
became the first truly safe space in which to talk back to ads. In an instant, the direction of the
scrutiny through the one-way glass of the focus group was reversed, and the target market took aim
at the people behind the glass. The most creative response came from students at the University of
Toronto. A handful of undergraduates landed part-time jobs with the washroom billboard company
and kept conveniently losing the custom-made screwdrivers that opened the four hundred plastic
frames. Pretty soon, a group calling themselves the Escher Appreciation Society were breaking into
the "student-proof frames and systematically replacing the bathroom ads with prints by Maurits
Cornelis Escher. Rather than brushing up on the latest from Chrysler or Molson, students could
learn to appreciate the Dutch graphic artist — chosen, the Escherites conceded, because his
geometric work photocopies well.
The bathroom ads made it unmistakably clear to a generation of student activists that they don't
need cooler, more progressive or more diverse ads — first and foremost, they need ads to shut up
once in a while. Debate on campuses began to shift away from an evaluation of the content of ads
to the fact that it was becoming impossible to escape from advertising's intrusive gaze.
Of course there are those among the culture jammers whose interest in advertising is less tapped
into the new ethos of anti-branding rage and instead has much in common with the morality squads
of the political correctness years. At times, Adbusters magazine feels like an only slightly hipper
version of a Public Service Announcement about saying no to peer pressure or remembering to
Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. The magazine is capable of lacerating wit, but its attacks on nicotine,
alcohol and fast-food joints can be repetitive and obvious. Jams that change Absolut Vodka to
"Absolut Hangover" or Ultra Kool cigarettes to "Utter Fool" cigarettes are enough to turn off
would-be supporters who see the magazine crossing a fine line between information-age civil
disobedience and puritanical finger-waving. Mark Dery, author of the original culture-jammers'
manifesto and a former contributor to the magazine, says the anti-booze, -smoking and -fast-food
emphasis reads as just plain patronizing —as if "the masses" cannot be trusted to "police their own
desires."

7	[n$g$_3d/	edcgg$^_7­¾j+9_3gF_u 	g$^/	ed
In a New Yorker article entitled "The Big Sell-out," author John Seabrook discusses the
phenomenon of "the marketer within." He argues persuasively that an emerging generation of
artists will not concern themselves with old ethical dilemmas like "selling out" since they are a
walking sales pitch for themselves already, intuitively understanding how to produce pre-packaged

art, to be their own brand. "The artists of the next generation will make their art with an internal
marketing barometer already in place. The auteur as marketer, the artist in a suit of his own: the
ultimate in vertical integration."
Seabrook is right in his observation that the rhythm of the pitch is hardwired into the synapses of
many young artists, but he is mistaken in assuming that the built-in marketing barometer will only
be used to seek fame and fortune in the culture industries. As Carly Stasko points out, many people
who grew up sold are so attuned to the tempo of marketing that as soon as they read or hear a new
slogan, they begin to flip it and play with it in their minds, as she herself does. For Stasko, it is the
adbuster that is within, and every ad campaign is a riddle just waiting for the right jam. So the skill
Seabrook identifies, which allows artists to write the press bumpf for their own gallery openings
and musicians to churn out metaphor-filled bios for their liner notes, is the same quality that makes
for a deadly clever culture jammer. The culture jammer is the activist artist as antimarketer, using a
childhood filled with Trix commercials, and an adolescence spent spotting the product placement
on Seinfeld, to mess with a system that once saw itself as a specialized science. Jamie Batsy, a
Toronto-area "hacktivist," puts it like this: "Advertisers and other opinion makers are now in a
position where they are up against a generation of activists that were watching television before
they could walk. This generation wants their brains back and mass media is their home turf."
Culture jammers are drawn to the world of marketing like moths to a flame, and the high-gloss
sheen on their work is achieved precisely because they still feel an affection — however deeply
ambivalent — for media spectacle and the mechanics of persuasion. "I think a lot of people who are
really interested in subverting advertising or studying advertising probably, at one time, wanted to
be ad people themselves," says Carrie McLaren, editor of the New York zine Stay Free/21 You can
see it in her own ad busts, which are painstakingly seamless in their design and savage in their
content. In one issue, a full-page anti-ad shows a beat-up kid face down on the concrete with no
shoes on. In the corner of the frame is a hand making away with his Nike sneakers. "Just do it," the
slogan says.
Nowhere is the adbuster's ear for the pitch used to fuller effect than in the promotion of adbusting
itself, a fact that might explain why culture jamming's truest believers often sound like an odd cross
between used-car salesmen and tenured semiotics professors. Second only to Internet hucksters and
rappers, adbusters are susceptible to a spiralling bravado and to a level of self-promotion that can be
just plain silly. There is much fondness for claiming to be Marshall McLuhan's son, daughter,
grandchild or bastard progeny. There is a strong tendency to exaggerate the power of wheat paste
and a damn good joke. And to overstate their own power: one culture-jamming manifesto, for
instance, explains that "the billboard artist's goal is to throw a well aimed spanner into the media's
gears, bringing the image factory to a shuddering halt."
Adbusters has taken this hard-sell approach to such an extreme that it has raised hackles among
rival culture jammers. Particularly galling to its critics is the magazine's line of anticonsumer
products that they say has made the magazine less a culture-jamming clearinghouse than a homeshopping network for adbusting accessories. Culture-jammer "tool boxes" are listed for sale:
posters, videos, stickers and postcards; most ironically, it used to sell calendars and T-shirts to

coincide with Buy Nothing Day, though better sense eventually prevailed. "What comes out is no
real alternative to our culture of consumption," Carrie McLaren writes. "Just a different brand."
Fellow Vancouver jammers Guerrilla Media (GM) take a more vicious shot at Adbusters in the GM
inaugural newsletter. "We promise there are no GM calendars, key chains or coffee mugs in the
offing. We are, however, still working on those T-shirts that some of you ordered — we're just
looking for that perfect sweatshop to produce them."

The attacks are much the same as those lobbed at every punk band that signs a record deal and
every zine that goes glossy: Adjusters has simply become too popular to have much cachet for the
radicals who once dusted it off in their local second-hand bookstore like a precious stone. But
beyond the standard-issue purism, the question of how best to "market" an antimarketing movement
is a uniquely thorny dilemma. There is a sense among some adbusters that culture jamming, like
punk itself, must remain something of a porcupine; that to defy its own inevitable commodification,
it must keep its protective quills sharp. After the great Alternative and Girl Power™ cash-ins, the
very process of naming a trend, or coining a catchphrase, is regarded by some with deep suspicion.
"Adbusters jumped on it and were ready to claim this movement before it ever really existed," says
McLaren, who complains bitterly in her own writing about the "USA Today/MTV-ization" of
Adbusters. "It's become an advertisement for anti-advertising."
There is another fear underlying this debate, one more confusing for its proponents than the
prospect of culture jamming "selling out" to the dictates of marketing. What if, despite all the
rhetorical flair its adherents can muster, culture jamming doesn't actually matter? What if there is
no jujitsu, only semiotic shadowboxing? Kalle Lasn insists that his magazine has the power to "jolt
post-modern society out of its media trance" and that his uncommercials threaten to shake network
television to its core. "The television mindscape has been homogenized over the last 30 to 40 years.
It's a space that is very safe for commercial messages. So, if you suddenly introduce a note of
cognitive dissonance with a spot that says 'Don't buy a car,' or in the middle of a fashion show
somebody suddenly says 'What about anorexia?' there's a powerful moment of truth." But the real
truth is that, as a culture, we seem to be capable of absorbing limitless amounts of cognitive
dissonance on our TV sets. We culture jam manually every time we channel surf— catapulting
from the desperate fundraising pleas of the Foster Parent Plan to infomercials for Buns of Steel;
from Jerry Springer to Jerry Falwell; from Mew Country to Marilyn Manson. In these informationnumb times, we are beyond being abruptly awakened by a startling image, a sharp juxtaposition or
even a fabulously clever detournement.
Jaggi Singh is one activist who has become disillusioned with the jujitsu theory. "When you're
jamming, you're sort of playing their game, and I think ultimately that playing field is stacked
against us because they can saturate... we don't have the resources to do all those billboards, we
don't have the resources to buy up all that time, and in a sense, it almost becomes pretty scientific
—who can afford these feeds?"

To add further evidence that culture jamming is more drop in the bucket than spanner in the works,
marketers are increasingly deciding to join in the fun. When Kalle Lasn says culture jamming has

the feeling of "a bit of a fad," he's not exaggerating. It turns out that culture jamming-with its
combination of hip-hop attitude, punk anti-authoritarianism and a well of visual gimmicks-has great
sales potential.
Yahoo! already has an official culture-jamming site on the Internet, filed under "alternative." At
Soho Down & Under on West Broadway in New York, Camden Market in London or any other
high street where alterno gear is for sale, you can load up on logo-jammed T-shirts, stickers and
badges. Recurring detournements — to use a word that seems suddenly misplaced — include Kraft
changed to "Krap," Tide changed to "Jive," Ford changed to "Fucked" and Goodyear changed to
"Goodbeer." It's not exactly trenchant social commentary, particularly since the jammed logos
appear to be interchangeable with the corporate kitsch of unaltered Dubble Bubble and Tide Tshirts. In the rave scene, logo play is all the rage-in clothing, temporary tattoos, body paint and even
ecstasy pills. Ecstasy dealers have taken to branding their tablets with famous logos: there is Big
Mac E, Purple Nike Swirl E, X-Files E, and a mixture of uppers and downers called a "Happy
Meal." Musician Jeff Renton explains the drug culture's appropriation of corporate logos as a revolt
against invasive marketing. "I think it's a matter of: 'You come into our lives with your milliondollar advertising campaigns putting logos in places that make us feel uncomfortable, so we're
going to take your logo back and use it in places that make you feel uncomfortable,'" he says.
But after a while, what began as a way to talk back to the ads starts to feel more like evidence of
our total colonization by them, and especially because the ad industry is proving that it is capable of
cutting off the culture jammers at the pass. Examples of pre-jammed ads include a 1997 Nike
campaign that used the slogan "I am not/A target market/I am an athlete" and Sprite's "Image Is
Nothing" campaign, featuring a young black man saying that all his life he has been bombarded
with media lies telling him that soft drinks will make him a better athlete or more attractive, until he
realized that "image is nothing." Diesel jeans, however, has gone furthest in incorporating the
political content of adbusting's Anticorporate attacks. One of the most popular ways for artists and
activists to highlight the inequalities of free-market globalization is by juxtaposing First World
icons with Third World scenes: Marlboro Country in the war-torn rubble of Beirut (see image, page
10); an obviously malnourished Haitian girl wearing Mickey Mouse glasses; Dynasty playing on a
TV set in an African hut; Indonesian students rioting in front of McDonald's arches. The power of
these visual critiques of happy one-worldism is precisely what the Diesel clothing company's
"Brand 0" ad campaign attempts to co-opt. The campaign features ads within ads: a series of
billboards flogging a fictional Brand 0 line of products in a nameless North Korean city. In one, a
glamorous skinny blonde is pictured on the side of a bus that is overflowing with frail-looking
workers. The ad is selling "Brand 0 Diet —There's no limit to how thin you can get." Another
shows an Asian man huddled under a piece of cardboard. Above him towers a Ken and Barbie
Brand 0 billboard.
Perhaps the point of no return came in 1997 when Mark Hosier of Negativ-land received a call from
the ultra-hip ad agency Wieden & Kennedy asking if the band that coined the term "culture
jamming" would do the soundtrack for a new Miller Genuine Draft commercial. The decision to
turn down the request and the money was simple enough, but it still sent him spinning. "They
utterly failed to grasp that our entire work is essentially in opposition to everything that they are
connected to, and it made me really depressed because I had thought that our aesthetic couldn't be
absorbed into marketing," Hosier says. Another rude awakening came when Hosier first saw
Sprite's "Obey Your Thirst" campaign. "That commercial was a hair's breadth away from a song on

our [Dispepsi] record. It was surreal. It's not just the fringe that's getting absorbed now-that's always
happened. What's getting absorbed now is the idea that there's no opposition left, that any resistance
is futile.""
I'm not so sure. Yes, some marketers have found a way to distil! culture jamming into a particularly
edgy kind of nonlinear advertising, and there is no doubt that Madison Avenue's embrace of the
techniques of adbusting has succeeded in moving product off the superstore shelves. Since Diesel
began its aggressively ironic "Reasons for Living" and "Brand 0" campaigns in the U.S., sales have
gone from $2 million to $23 million in four years,30 and the Sprite "Image Is Nothing" campaign is
credited with a 35 percent rise in sales in just three years." That said, the success of these individual
campaigns has done nothing to disarm the antimarketing rage that fuelled adbusting in the first
place. In fact, it may be having the opposite effect.

The prospect of young people turning against the hype of advertising and defining themselves
against the big brands is a continuous threat coming from cool-hunting agencies like Sputnik, that
infamous team of professional diary readers and generational snoops. "Intellectual crews," as
Sputnik calls thinking young people, are aware and resentful of how useful they are to the
marketers:
They understand that mammoth corporations now seek their approval to continually deliver goods
that will translate to megasales in the mainstream. Their stance of being intellectual says to each
other, and to themselves, and most importantly to marketers — who spend innumerable dollars for
in-your-face this-is-what-you-need advertisements — that they cannot be bought or fooled anymore
by the hype. Being a head means that you won't sell out and be told what to wear, what to buy,
what to cat or how to speak by anyone (or anything) other than yourself.'2
But while the Sputnik writers inform their corporate readers about the radical ideas on the street,
they appear to think that though these ideas will dramatically influence how young people will
party, dress and talk, they will magically have no effect whatsoever on how young people will
behave as political beings.
After they sound the alarm, the hunters always reassure their readers that all this Anticorporate stuff
is actually a meaningless pose that can be worked around with a hipper, edgier campaign. In other
words, Anticorporate rage is no more meaningful a street trend than a mild preference for the colour
orange. The happy underlying premise of the cool hunters' reports is that despite all the punk-rock
talk, there is no belief that is a true belief and there are no rebels who cannot be tamed with an ad
campaign or by a street promoter who really speaks to them. The unquestioned assumption is that
there is no end point in this style cycle. There will always be new spaces to colonize— whether
physical or mental —and there will always be an ad that will be able to penetrate the latest strain of
consumer cynicism. Nothing new is taking place, the hunters tell each other: marketers have always
extracted symbols and signs from the resistance movements of their day.
What they don't say is that previous waves of youth resistance were focused primarily on such foes
as "the establishment," the government, the patriarchy and the military-industrial complex. Culture
jamming is different—its rage encompasses the very type of marketing that the cool hunters and

their clients are engaging in as they try to figure out how to use anti-marketing rage to sell products.
The big brands' new ads must incorporate a youth cynicism not about products as status symbols, or
about mass homogenization, but about multinational brands themselves as tireless culture vultures.
The admen and adwomen have met this new challenge without changing their course. They are
busily hunting down and reselling the edge, just as they have always done, which is why Wieden &
Kennedy thought there was nothing strange about asking Negativland to shill for Miller. After all, it
was Wieden & Kennedy, a boutique ad agency based in Portland, Oregon, that made Nike a
feminist sneaker. It was W&K who dreamed up the post-industrial alienation marketing plan for
Coke's OK Cola; W&K who gave the world the immortal plaid-clad assertion that the Subaru
Impreza was "like punk rock"; and it was W&K who brought Miller Beer into the age of irony.
Masters at pitting the individual against various incarnations of mass-market bogeymen, Wieden &
Kennedy sold cars to people who hated car ads, shoes to people who loathed image, soft drinks to
the Prozac Nation and, most of all, ads to people who were "not a target market."
The agency was founded by two self-styled "beatnik artists," Dan Wieden and David Kennedy,
whose technique, it seems, for quieting their own nagging fears that they were selling out has
consistently been to drag the ideas and icons of the counterculture with them into the ad world. A
quick tour through the agency's body of work is nothing short of a counterculture reunionWoodstock meets the Beats meets Warhol's Factory. After putting Lou Reed in a Honda spot in the
mid-eighties, W&K used the Beatles anthem "Revolution" in one Nike commercial, then carted out
John Lennon's "Instant Karma" for another. They also paid proto-rock-and-roller Bo Diddley to do
the "Bo Knows" Nike spots, and filmmaker Spike Lee to do an entire series of Air Jordan ads.
W&K even got Jean-Luc Godard to direct a European Nike commercial. There were still more
countercultural artefacts lying around: they stuck William Burroughs's face in a mini-TV-set in
another Nike commercial and designed a campaign, nixed by Subaru before it made it to air, that
used Jack Kerouac's On the Road as the voice-over text for an SVX commercial.
After making its name on the willingness of the avant-garde to set its price for the right mix of
irony and dollars, W&K can hardly be blamed for thinking that culture jammers would also be
thrilled to take part in the post-modern fun of a self-aware ad campaign. But the backlash against
the brands, of which culture jamming is only one part, isn't about vague notions of alternativeness
battling the mainstream. It has to do with the specific issues that have been the subject of this book
so far: the loss of public space, corporate censorship and unethical labour practices, to name but
three-issues less easily digested than tasty morsels like Girl Power and grunge.
Which is why Wieden & Kennedy hit a wall when they asked Negativland to mix for Miller, and
why that was only the first in a string of defeats for the agency. The British political pop-band
Chumbawamba turned down a S 1.5 million contract that would have allowed Nike to use its hit
song "Tub-thumping" in a World Cup spot. Abstract notions about staying indie were not at issue
(the band did allow the song to be used in the soundtrack for Home Alone 3; at the centre of their
rejection was Nike's use of sweatshop labour. "It took everybody in the room under 30 seconds to
say no," said band member Alice Nutter. The political poet Martin Espada also got a call from one
of Nike's smaller agencies, inviting him to take part in the "Nike Poetry Slam." If he accepted, he
would be paid $2,500 and his poem would be read in a thirty-second commercial during the 1998
Winter Olympics in Nagano. Espada turned the agency down flat, offering up a host of reasons and
ending with this one: "Ultimately, however, I am rejecting your offer as a protest against the brutal

labour practices of the company. I will not associate myself with a company that engages in the
well-documented exploitation of workers in sweatshops." The rudest awakening came with Wieden
& Kennedy's cleverest of schemes: in May 1999, with labour scandals still hanging over the
swoosh, the agency approached Ralph Nader —the consumer-rights movement's most powerful
leader and a folk hero for his attacks on multinational corporations — and asked him to do a Nike
ad. The idea was simple: Nader would get $25,000 for holding up an Air 120 sneaker and saying,
"Another shameless attempt by Nike to sell shoes." A letter sent to Nader's office from Nike
headquarters explained that "what we are asking is for Ralph, as the country's most prominent
consumer advocate, to take a light-hearted jab at us. This is a very Nike-like thing to do in our ads."
Nader, never known for being light of heart, would only say, "Look at the gall of these guys."
It was indeed a very Nike-like thing to do. Ads co-opt out of reflex — they do so because
consuming is what consumer culture does. Madison Avenue is generally not too picky about what it
will swallow, it doesn't avoid poison directed against itself but rather, as Wieden & Kennedy have
shown, chomps down on whatever it finds along the path as it looks for the new "edge." The
scenario that it appears unwilling to consider is that its admen and adwomen, the perennial teenage
followers, may finally be following their target market off a cliff.

Of course the ad industry has disarmed backlashes before — from women complaining of sexism,
gays claiming invisibility, ethnic minorities tired of gross caricatures. And that's not all. In the
1950s and again in the 1970s, Western consumers became obsessed with the idea that they were
being fooled by advertisers through the covert use of subliminal techniques. In 1957, Vance
Packard published the runaway best-seller The Hidden Persuaders, which shocked Americans with
allegations that social scientists were packing advertisements with messages invisible to the human
eye. The issue re-emerged in 1973, when Wilson Bryan Key published Subliminal Seduction, a
study of the lascivious messages tucked away in ice cubes. Key was so transported by his discovery
that he made such bold claims as "the subliminal promise to anyone buying Gilbey's gin is simply a
good old-fashioned sexual orgy."
But all these antimarketing spasms had one thing in common: they focused exclusively on the
content and techniques of advertising. These critics didn't want to be subliminally manipulated —
and they did want African Americans in their cigarette ads and gays and lesbians selling jeans.
Because the concerns were so specific, they were relatively easy for the ad world to address or
absorb. For instance, the charge of hidden messages harboured in ice cubes, and other carefully cast
shadows, spawned an irony-laden advertising subgenre that design historians Ellen Luton and J.
Abbot Miller term "meta-subliminal" —ads that parody the charge that ads send secret messages. In
1990, Absolut Vodka launched the "Absolut Subliminal" campaign which showed a glass of vodka
on the rocks with the word "absolut" clearly screened into the ice cubes. Seagram's and Tanqueray
gin followed with their own subliminal in-jokes, as did the cast of Saturday Night Live with the
recurring character Subliminal Man.
The critiques of advertising that have traditionally come out of academe have been equally
unthreatening, though for different reasons. Most such criticism focuses not on the effects of
marketing on public space, cultural freedom and democracy, but rather on ads' persuasive powers

over seemingly clueless people. For the most part, marketing theory concentrates on the way ads
implant false desires in the consuming public —making us buy things that are bad for us, pollute
the planet or impoverish our souls. "Advertising," as George Orwell once said, "is the rattling of a
stick inside a swill bucket." When such is the theorist's opinion of the public, it is no wonder that
there is little potential for redemption in most media criticism: this sorry populace will never be in
possession of the critical tools it needs to formulate a political response to marketing mania and
media synergy.
The future is even bleaker for those academics who use advertising criticism for a thinly veiled
attack on "consumer culture." As James Twitchell writes in Adcult USA, most advertising criticism
reeks of contempt for the people who "want —ugh! —things." Such a theory can never hope to
form the intellectual foundation of an actual resistance movement against the branded life, since
genuine political empowerment cannot be reconciled with a belief system that regards the public as
a bunch of ad-fed cattle, held captive under commercial culture's hypnotic spell. What's the point of
going through the trouble of trying to knock down the fence? Everyone knows the branded cows
will just stand there looking dumb and chewing cud.
Interestingly, the last time that there was a successful attack on the practice of advertising — rather
than a disagreement on its content or techniques — was during the Great Depression. In the 1930s
the very idea of the happy, stable consumer society portrayed in advertising provoked a wave of
resentment from the millions of Americans who found themselves on the outside of the dream of
prosperity. An anti-advertising movement emerged that attacked ads not for faulty imagery but as
the most public face of a deeply faulty economic system. People weren't incensed by the pictures in
the ads, but rather by the cruelty of the obviously false promise that they represented — the lie of
the American Dream that the happy consumer lifestyle was accessible to all. In the late twenties,
and through the thirties, the frivolous promises of the ad world made for stomach-wrenching
juxtapositions with the casualties of economic collapse, setting the stage for an unparalleled wave
of consumer activism.
There was a short-lived magazine published in New York called The Ballyhoo, a sort of
Depression-era Adbusters. In the wake of the 1929 stock-market crash, The Ballyhoo arrived as a
cynical new voice, viciously mocking the "creative psychiatry" of cigarette and mouthwash ads, as
well as the outright quackery used to sell all kinds of potions and lotions. The Ballyhoo was an
instant success, reaching a circulation of more than 1.5 million in 1931. James Rorty, a 1920s Mad
Ave adman turned revolutionary socialist, explained the new magazine's appeal: "Whereas the
stock in trade of the ordinary mass or class consumer magazine is reader-confidence in advertising,
the stock in trade of Ballyhoo was reader-disgust with advertising, and with high-pressure
salesmanship in general.... Ballyhoo, in turn, parasites on the grotesque, bloated body of
advertising."
Ballyhoo's culture jams include "Scramel" cigarettes ("they're so fresh they're insulting"), or the
line of " different Zilch creams: What the well greased girls will wear. Absolutely indispensable
(Ask any dispensary)." The editors encouraged readers to move beyond their snickers and go out
and bust bothersome billboards themselves. A fake ad for the "Twitch Toucher Upper School"
shows a drawing of a woman who has just painted a moustache on a glamorous cigarette model.
The caption reads, "Become a Toucher Upper!" and goes on to say: "If you long to mess up
advertisement: if your heart cries out to paint pipes in the mouths of beautiful ladies, try this 10-

second test NOW! Our graduates make their marks all over the world! Good Toucher Uppers are
always in demand" (see image on page 278). The magazine also created fake products to skewer the
hypocrisy of the Hoover administration, like the "Lady Pipperal Bedsheet De Luxe" — made extra
long to snugly fit on park benches when you become homeless. Or the "smilette" - two hooks that
clamp on to either side of the mouth and force a happy expression. "Smile away the Depression!
Smile us into Prosperity!"
The hard-core culture jammers of the era were not the Ballyhoo humorists, however, but
photographers like Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange and Margaret Bourke-White. These political
documentarians latched on to the hypocrisies of ad campaigns such as the National Association of
Manufacturers' "There's No Way Like the American Way" by highlighting the harsh visual
contrasts between the ads and the surrounding landscape. A popular technique was photographing
billboards with slogans like "World's Highest Standard of Living" in their actual habitat: hanging
surreally over breadlines and tenements. The manic grinning models piled into the family sedan
were clearly blind to the tattered masses and squalid conditions below. The photographers of the era
also scrupulously documented the fragility of the capitalist system by picturing fallen businessmen
holding up "Will Work for Food" signs in the shadow of looming Coke billboards and peeling
hoardings. In 1934, advertisers began to use self-parody to deal with the mounting criticism they
faced, a tactic that some saw as proof of the industry's state of disrepair. "It is contended by the
broadcasters, and doubtless also by the movie producers, that this burlesque sales promotion takes
the curse out of sales talk, and this is probably true to a degree," writes Rorty of the self-mockery.
"But the prevalence of the trend gives rise to certain ominous suspicions... When the burlesque
comedian mounts the pulpit of the Church of Advertising, it may be legitimately suspected that the
edifice is doomed; that it will shortly be torn down or converted to secular uses."
Of course the edifice survived, though not unscathed. New Deal politicians, under pressure from a
wide range of populist movements, imposed lasting reforms on the industry. The adbusters and
social documentary photographers were part of a massive grassroots public revolt against big
business that included the farmers' uprising against the proliferation of supermarket chains, the
establishing of consumer purchasing cooperatives, the rapid expansion of a network of trade unions
and a crackdown on garment industry sweatshops (which had seen the ranks of the two U.S.
garment workers' unions swell from 40,000 in 1931 to more than 300,000 in 1933). Most of all, the
early ad critics were intimately linked to the burgeoning consumer movement that had been
catalyzed by One Hundred Million Guinea Pigs: Dangers in Everyday Foods, Drugs and Cosmetics
(1933), by F.J. Schlink and Arthur Kallet, and Your Money's Worth: A Study in the Waste of the
Consumer Dollar (1927), written by Stuart Chase and F.J. Schlink. These books presented
exhaustive catalogs of the way regular folks were getting lied to, cheated, poisoned and ripped off
by America's captains of industry. The authors founded Consumer Research (later splintered off
into the Consumers Union), which served both as an independent product-testing laboratory and a
political group that lobbied the government for better grading and labelling of products. The CR
believed objective testing and truthful labelling could make marketing so irrelevant it would
become obsolete. According to Chase and Schlink's logic, if consumers had access to careful
scientific research that compared the relative merits of the products on the market, everyone would
simply make measured, rational decisions about what to buy. The advertisers, of course, were
beside themselves, and terrified of the following F.J. Schlink had built up on the college campuses
and among the New York intelligentsia. As adman C.B. Larrabee noted in 1934, "Some forty or

fifty thousand persons won't so much as buy a box of dog biscuits unless F.J. gives his 'O.K.'...
obviously they think most advertisers are dishonest, double-dealing shysters."
Schlink and Chase's rationalist Utopia of Spock-like consumerism never came to fruition, but their
lobbying did force governments around the world to move to outlaw blatantly false claims in
advertising, to establish quality standards for consumer goods, and to become actively involved in
the grading and labelling of them. And the Consumers Union Reports is still the buyer's bible in
America, though it long ago severed its ties to other social movements.
It is worth noting that the modern-day ad world's most extreme attempts to co-opt Anticorporate
rage have fed directly off images pioneered by the Depression-era documentary photographers.
Diesel's Brand 0 is almost a direct replica of Margaret Bourke-White's "American Way" billboard
series, both in style and composition. And when the Bank of Montreal ran an ad campaign in
Canada in the late nineties, at the height of a popular backlash against soaring bank profits, it used
images that recalled Walker Evans's photographs of 1930s businessmen holding up those "Will
Work for Food" signs. The bank's campaign consisted of a series of grainy black-and-white
photographs of ragged-looking people holding signs that asked, "Will I ever own my own home?"
and "Are we going to be okay?" One sign simply read, "The little guy is on his own." The
television spots blasted Depression-era gospel and ragtime over eerie industrial images of
abandoned freight trains and dusty towns.
In other words, when the time came to fight fire with fire, the advertisers raced back to an era when
they were never more loathed and only a world war could save them. It seems that this kind of
psychic shock —a clothing company using the very images that have scarred the clothing industry;
a bank trading on anti-bank rage - is the only technique left that will get the attention of us adresistant roaches. And this may well be true, from a marketing point of view, but there is also a
larger context that reaches beyond imagery: Diesel produces many of its garments in Indonesia and
other parts of the Far East, profiting from the very disparities illustrated in its clever Brand 0 ads. In
fact, part of the edginess of the campaign is the clear sense that the company is flirting with a Nikestyle public-relations meltdown. So far, the Diesel brand does not have a wide enough market reach
to feel the full force of having its images slingshot back at its body corporate, but the bigger the
company gets — and it is getting bigger every year — the more vulnerable it becomes.
That was the lesson in the responses to the Bank of Montreal's "Sign of the Times" campaign. The
bank's use of powerful images of economic collapse at exactly the same time that it announced
record profits of $986 million (up in 1998 to $1.3 billion) inspired a spontaneous wave of
adbusting. The simple imagery of the campaign — people holding up angry signs — was easy for
the bank's critics to replicate with parodies that skewered the bank's exorbitant service fees, its
inaccessible loans officers and the closing of branches in low-income neighbourhoods (after all, the
bank's technique had been stolen from the activists in the first place). Everyone got in on the action:
lone jammers, CBC television's satirical show This Hour Has 22 Minutes, The Globe and Mail's
Report on Business Magazine, and independent video collectives.
Clearly, these ad campaigns are tapping into powerful emotions. But by playing on sentiments that
are already directed against them — for example, public resentment at profiteering banks or
widening economic disparities — the process of co-optation runs the very real risk of amplifying
the backlash, not disarming it. Above all, imagery appropriation appears to radicalize culture

jammers and other Anticorporate activists —a "co-opt this!" stance develops that becomes even
harder to diffuse. For instance, when Chrysler ran a campaign of pre-jammed Neon ads (the one
that added a faux aerosol "p," changing "Hi" to "Hip"), it inspired the Billboard Liberation Front to
go on its biggest tear in years. The BLF defaced dozens of Bay Area Neon billboards by further
altering "Hip" to "Hype," and adding, for good measure, a skull and crossbones. "We can't sit by
while these companies co-opt our means of communication," Jack Napier said. "Besides...they're
tacky."
Perhaps the gravest miscalculation on the part of both markets and media is the insistence on seeing
culture jamming solely as harmless satire, a game that exists in isolation from a genuine political
movement or ideology. Certainly for some jammers, parody is perceived, in rather grandiose
fashion, as a powerful end in itself. But for many more, as we will see in the next chapters, it is
simply a new tool for packaging Anticorporate salvos, one that is more effective than most at
breaking through the media barrage. And as we will also see, adbusters are currently at work on
many different fronts: the people scaling billboards are frequently the same ones who are
organizing against the Multilateral Agreement on Investment, staging protests on the streets of
Geneva against the World Trade Organization and occupying banks to protest against the profits
they are making from student debts. Adbusting is not an end in itself. It is simply a tool - one
among many- that is being used, loaned and borrowed in a much broader political movement
against the branded life.

CHAPTER THIRTEEN
RECLAIM THE STREETS

I picture the reality in which we live in terms of military occupation. We are occupied the way the
French and Norwegians were occupied by the Nazis during World War II, but this time by an army
of marketeers. We have to reclaim our country from those who occupy it on behalf of their global
masters.
-Ursula Franklin, Professor Emeritus, University of Toronto, 1998
This is not a protest. Repeat. This is not a protest. This is some kind of artistic expression. Over.
-A call that went out on Metro Toronto police radios on May 16, 1998, the date of the first Global
Street Party
It is one of the ironies of our age that now, when the street has become the hottest commodity in
advertising culture, street culture itself is under siege. From New York to Vancouver to London,
police crackdowns on graffiti, postering, panhandling, sidewalk art, squeegee kids, community
gardening and food vendors are rapidly criminalizing everything that is truly street-level in the life
of a city.

This tension between the commodification and criminalization of street culture has unfolded in a
particularly dramatic manner in England. In the early to mid-nineties, as the ad world leaped to
harness the sounds and imagery of the rave scene to sell cars, airlines, soft drinks and newspapers,
the lawmakers in Britain made raves all but illegal, through the 1994 Criminal Justice Act. The act
gave police far-reaching powers to seize sound equipment and deal harshly with ravers in any
public confrontations.
To fight the Criminal Justice Act, the club scene (previously preoccupied with searching out the
next all-night dance site) forged new alliances with more politicized subcultures that were also
alarmed by these new police powers. Ravers got together with squatters facing eviction, with the
so-called New Age travellers facing crackdowns on their nomadic lifestyle, and with radical "ecowarriors" fighting the paving-over of Britain's woodland areas by building tree houses and digging
tunnels in the bulldozers' paths. A common theme began to emerge among these struggling
countercultures: the right to uncolonized space —for homes, for trees, for gathering, for dancing.
What sprang out of these cultural collisions among deejays, anti-corporate activists, political and
New Age artists and radical ecologists may well be the most vibrant and fastest-growing political
movement since Paris '68: Reclaim the Streets (RTS).
Since 1995, RTS has been hijacking busy streets, major intersections and even stretches of highway
for spontaneous gatherings. In an instant, a crowd of seemingly impromptu partyers transforms a
traffic artery into a surrealist playpen. Here's how it works. Like the location of the original raves,
the RTS party's venue is kept secret until the day. Thousands gather at the designated meeting
place, from which they depart en masse to a destination known only to a handful of organizers.
Before the crowds arrive, a van rigged up with a powerful sound system is surreptitiously parked on
the soon-to-be-reclaimed street. Next, some theatrical means of blocking traffic is devised — for
example, two old cars deliberately crash into each other and a mock fight is staged between the
drivers. Another technique is to plant twenty-foot scaffolding tripods in the middle of the roadway
with a brave lone activist suspended high up top — the tripod poles prevent cars from passing but
people can weave between them freely; and since to knock the tripod over would send the person
on top crashing to the ground, the police have no recourse but to stand by and watch the events
unfold. With traffic safely blocked, the roadway is declared a "street now open." Signs go up that
say "Breathe," "Car Free," and "Reclaim Space." The RTS flag - a bolt of lightning on different
colored backdrops — goes up and the sound system begins to blast everything from the latest
electronic offerings to Louis Armstrong's "What a Wonderful World." Then seemingly out of
nowhere comes the travelling carnival of RTSers: bikers, stilt walkers, ravers, drummers. At
previous parties, jungle gyms have been set up in the middle of intersections, as well as giant
sandboxes, swing sets, wading pools, couches, throw rugs and volleyball nets. Hundreds of
Frisbees sail through the air, free food is circulated and the dancing begins-on cars, at bus stops, on
roofs and near signposts. Organizers describe their road-nappings as anything from the realization
of "a collective daydream" to "a large-scale coincidence." Like ad-busters, RTSers have transposed
the language and tactics of radical ecology into the urban jungle, demanding uncommercialized
space in the city as well as natural wilderness in the country or on the seas. In this spirit, the most
theatrical RTS stunt occurred 10,000 partyers took over London's M41, a six-lane highway. Two
people dressed in elaborate carnival costumes sat thirty feet above the roadway, perched on
scaffolding contraptions that were covered by huge hoop skirts (see image on page 310). The police
standing by had no idea that underneath the skirts were guerrilla gardeners with jackhammers,
drilling holes in the highway and planting saplings in the asphalt. The RTSers — die-hard

Situationist fans —had made their point: "Beneath the tarmac... a forest," a reference to the Paris
'68 slogan, "Beneath the cobblestones...a beach."
The events take culture jamming's philosophy of reclaiming public space to another level. Rather
than filling the space left by commerce with advertising parodies, the RTSers attempt to fill it with
an alternative vision of what society might look like in the absence of commercial control.
The crowd followed us and the road turned form a traffic jam to a road rave with hundreds of
people shouting and demanding clean air, public transport and bicycle lanes. – RTS E-mail, Tel
Aviv, Israel, May 16, 1998.
The seeds of RTS's urban environmentalism were planted in 1993 on Claremont Road, a quiet
London street slated to disappear under a new expressway. "The M11 Link Road," explains RTSer
John Jordan, "will stretch from Wanstead to Hackney in East London. To build it, the Department
of Transport had to knock down 350 houses, displace several thousand people, cut through one of
London's last ancient woodlands and devastate a community with a six-lane-wide stretch of tarmac
at the cost of 240 million pounds, apparently to save six minutes on a car journey." When the city
ignored fierce local opposition to the road, a group of activist artists took it upon themselves to try
to block the bulldozers by turning Claremont Road into a living sculptural fortress. They pulled
sofas into the streets, hung TVs from tree branches, painted a giant chessboard in the middle of the
road and put up spoof suburban development billboards in front of the houses slated for demolition:
"Welcome to Claremont Road —Ideal Homes." The activists moved into chestnut trees, occupied
construction cranes, blasted music and blew kisses at the cops and demolition workers below. The
now empty houses were transformed — connected to each other through underground tunnels and
filled with art installations. Outside, old cars were painted with slogans and zebra stripes and turned
into flower boxes. The cars were not only made beautiful, they also made effective barricades, as
did a hundred-foot scaffolding tower built through the roof of one of the homes. The tactic, Jordan
explains, was not the use of art to achieve political ends but the transformation of art into a
pragmatic political tool "both beautiful and functional."
When Claremont Road was levelled in November 1994, it had become the most creative,
celebratory, vibrantly living street in London. It was "a kind of temporary microcosm of a truly
liberated, ecological culture," according to Jordan. By the time all the activists had been cherrypicked out of their tree houses and fortresses, the point of the action -that high-speed roads suck the
life out of a city-could have had no more graphic or eloquent expression.
Though another group had used the same name some years earlier, the current incarnation of
Reclaim the Streets was formed in May 1995, with the express purpose of turning what happened
on Claremont Road into an airborne virus that could spread at any time, to any place in the city-a
roving "temporary autonomous zone," to use a term coined by the American anarchist guru Hakim
Bey. According to Jordan, the thinking was simple: "If we could no longer reclaim Claremont
Road, we would reclaim the streets of London." Five hundred people showed up to the RTS party
on Camden Street in May 1995 to dance to a bicycle-powered sound system, drums and whistles.
With the Criminal Justice Act in full effect, the gathering caught the attention of the newly
politicized rave scene and a key alliance was formed. At RTS's next event, three thousand people

showed up to the party on Upper Street, Islington; this time they danced to electronic music
blasting from two trucks equipped with club-quality sound systems.
The combination of rave and rage has proved contagious, spreading across Britain to Manchester,
York, Oxford and Brighton, and in the largest single RTS event to date, drawing 20,000 people to
Trafalgar Square in April 1997. By then, Reclaim the Street parties had gone international, popping
up in cities as far away as Sydney, Helsinki and Tel Aviv. Each party is locally organized, but with
the help of E-mail lists and linked Web sites, activists in different cities are able to read reports
from events around the world, swap cop-dodging strategies, trade information on building effective
roadblocks, and read each other's posters, press releases and flyers. Since video and digital cameras
appear to be the accessories of choice at the street parties, RTSers also draw inspiration from
watching footage of faraway parties, which is circulated through activist video networks, such as
the Oxford-based Undercurrents, and uploaded onto several RTS Web sites.
Anarchists among the crowd took advantage of the opportunity to vent their fury on banks, jewellery shops and local
branches of McDonald’s Windows were smashed, paint bombs hurled and anti-globalisation slogans graffitied. – RTS
E-mail report, Geneva Switzerland May 16, 1998.

In many cities, the street parties have dovetailed with another explosive new international
movement —the Critical Mass bicycle rides. The idea started in San Francisco in 1992 and began
spreading to cities across North America, Europe and Australia at roughly the same time as RTS.
Critical Mass bicycle riders also favour the rhetoric of large-scale coincidence: in dozens of cities,
on the last Friday of every month, anywhere from seventeen to seven thousand cyclists gather at a
designated intersection and go for a ride together. By force of their numbers, the bikers form a
critical mass and the cars must yield to them. "We're not blocking traffic," the Critical Mass riders
say, "we are the traffic." Since there's a fair amount of overlap between RTS partyers and Critical
Mass riders, it has become a popular tactic for the sites of street parties to be cleared of traffic by
"spontaneous" Critical Mass rides that sweep through the area just moments before the blockades
are set up and the partyers arrive.
Perhaps in light of these connections, the mainstream media almost invariably describe RTS events
as "anti-car protests." Most RTSers, however, insist that this is a profound oversimplification of
their goals. The car is a symbol, they say —the most tangible manifestation of the loss of
communal space, walkable streets and sites of free expression. Rather than simply opposing the use
of automobiles, as Jordan says, "RTS has always tried to take the single issue of transportation and
the car into a wider critique of society...to dream of reclaiming space for collective use, as
commons." To underline these wider connections, RTS organized one London street party in
solidarity with striking London Underground workers. Another was a joint event with those
darlings of British rock stars, soccer players and anarchists — the sacked Liverpool dock workers.
Other actions have taken on the ecological and human rights records of Shell, BP and Mobil.
These coalitions make RTS extremely difficult to categorize. "Is a street party a political rally?"
asks Jordan rhetorically. "A festival? A rave? Direct action? Or just a bloody good party?" In many
ways, the parties have defied easy labelling: they camouflage identifiable leaders, and have no
centre or even a focal point. RTS parties "swirl," as Jordan says.

Not only is the confusion deliberate, but it is precisely this absence of rigidity that has helped RTS
to capture the imagination of thousands of young people around the world. Since the days when
Abbie Hoffman and the Yippies infused self-conscious absurdity into their "happenings," political
protest had lapsed into a ritualized affair, following a fairly unimaginative grid of repetitive chants
and scripted police confrontation. Pop, in the meantime, had become equally formulaic in its refusal
to let the perceived earnestness of political conviction enter its ironic play space. Which is where
RTS comes in. The deliberate culture clashes of the street parties mix the earnest predictability of
politics with the amused irony of pop. For many people in their teens and twenties, this presents the
first opportunity to reconcile being creatures of their Saturday-morning-cartoon childhoods with a
genuine political concern for their communities and environment. RTS is just playful and ironic
enough to finally make earnestness possible.
In many ways, Reclaim the Streets is the urban centrepiece of England's thriving do-it-yourself
subculture. Exiled to the economic margins by decades of Tory rule, and given little reason to
return by the right-of-centre policies of Tony Blair's New Labour Party, a largely self-reliant
infrastructure of food co-ops, illegal squats, independent media and free music festivals has
emerged across the country. Spontaneous street parties are an extension of the DIY lifestyle,
asserting as they do that people can make their own fun without asking any state's permission or
relying on any corporation's largesse. At a street party, just showing up makes you both a
participant and part of the entertainment.
The street party is also at odds with the way our culture tends to imagine freedom. Whether it's
hippies dropping out to live in rural communes, or yuppies escaping the urban jungle in sport utility
vehicles, freedom is usually about abandoning the claustrophobia of the city. Freedom is Route 66,
it's "On the Road." It's eco-travel. It's anywhere but here. RTS, on the other hand, doesn't write off
the city or the present. It harnesses the urge for entertainment and raves (and its darker side —the
desire to freak out and riot) and channels them into an act of civil disobedience that is also a
festival. For a day, the longing for free space is not about escape but transformation of the here and
now.
We visited the Virgin at the place of the cathedral, who certainly didn’t expect us and therefore didn’t join the dance.
In spite of this we offered a very nice sunny show till later that night, past eleven o’clock, reclaiming the street for
about five hours. – RTS E-mail report, Valencia, Spain, May 16, 1998.

Of course, if you want to be really cynical, RTS is also flowery eco-poetry about vandalism. It's
high-minded talk about blocking traffic. It's wildly dressed and painted kids screeching at
extremely confused and possibly well-meaning cops about the tyranny of "car culture." And when
RTS events go wrong — because only a handful of people show up, or the antihierarchy anarchist
organizers are unable or unwilling to communicate with the crowd — that's exactly what the party
becomes: some jerk demanding the right to sit in the middle of the street for a loony reason known
only to him. But at their best, RTS actions have been too joyful and humane to dismiss, cracking
the cynicism of many onlookers, from the hip British music press, which declared the party at
Trafalgar Square "the best illegal rave or dance music party in history," to one striking Liverpool
docker who noted that "the others talk about doing something - this lot actually do it."
And, as with all successful radical movements, some voice concern that the mass appeal of RTS has
made it too fashionable, that the subtle theory of "applying radical poetry to radical politics" is
getting drowned out by the pounding beat and the mob mentality. In October 1997, Jordan told me

that RTS was going through a process of rigorous re-examination. He claimed that the 20,000strong Trafalgar Square party was not the sort of climax RTS had been moving toward. When the
police tried to impound the van containing the sound system, protestors didn't cheekily blow kisses
as hoped, they hurled bottles and rocks and four people were charged with attempted murder (the
charges were later dropped). Despite the organizers' best efforts, RTS was spiralling into soccer
hooliganism and, as one RTS spokesperson told The Daily Telegraph, when the organizers tried to
regain control, some rioters turned against them. "I saw some of our people actually trying to stop
yobbos who had got tanked up on beer and were mindlessly throwing bottles and rocks. A few of
our contingent actually put themselves into the firing line and one was beaten up...." Such shades of
grey, however, were lost on most in the British media who covered Trafalgar Square with headlines
like "Riot Frenzy —Anarchist Thugs Bring Terror to London."

After Trafalgar Square, Jordan says, it became clear that "it was too easy for the street party to be
seen as just fun, just a party with a hint of political action.... If people think that turning up to a
street party once a year, getting out of your head and dancing your heart out on a recaptured piece
of public land is enough, then we are failing to reach our potential." The next task, he said, is to
imagine a takeover bigger than just one street. "The street party is only a beginning, a taster of
future possibilities. To date there have been 30 street parties all over the country. Imagine that
growing to 100, imagine each one of those happening on the same day, imagine each one lasting for
days on end and growing.... Imagine the street party growing roots... la fete permanente....""
I admit that at the time I spoke to Jordan I was sceptical that this movement could pull off that level
of coordination. At the best of times, Reclaim the Streets walks a delicate line, flirting openly with
the urge to riot but attempting to flip it into a more constructive protest. The London RTSers say
that one of the goals of the parties is to "visualize industrial collapse" - the challenge, then, is for
participants to inspire one another enough to dance and plant trees in the rubble, rather than to
douse it with gasoline and drop a Zippo. But shortly after our interview, a notice went out on a
couple of activist E-mail lists, floating the idea of a coordinated day of simultaneous street parties
around the world. Seven months later, the first-ever Global Street Party was under way. To make
absolutely sure that the political underpinning of the event didn't get lost, the date chosen for the
Global Street Party was May 16, 1998 —the same day the G-8 leaders gathered for a summit in
Birmingham, England, and two days before they would proceed to Geneva to celebrate the fiftieth
anniversary of the World Trade Organization. With Indian farmers, landless Brazilian peasants,
unemployed French, Italian and German workers and international human-rights groups planning
simultaneous actions around the two summits, RTS took its place in a fledgling international
grassroots movement against transnational corporations and their agenda of economic
globalization. This was definitely not just about cars.
The police attack was so hard and brutal that even the Czech public was shocked … Sixty-four people were detained
including 22 of those younger than 18 and 13 woman. During the police action, innocent people (who were just
walking around) were also beaten. All detainees were beaten. All detainees were beaten, mistreated and humiliated
until morning hours. RTS E-mail report, Prague, Czech Republic, May 16, 1998.

Though rarely reported as more than isolated traffic snares, thirty RTS events were successfully
mounted around the world, in twenty different countries. On May 16, more than eight hundred

people blocked a six-lane highway in Utrecht, the Netherlands, dancing for five hours. In Turku,
Finland, two thousand partyers peacefully occupied one of the main bridges in the city. Almost a
thousand Berliners held a rave at a downtown intersection and in Berkeley, California, seven
hundred people played Twister on Telegraph Avenue. By far the most successful of the Global
Street Parties was in Sydney, Australia, where an illegal political rally cum music festival went off
without a hitch; between three and four thousand people "kidnapped" a road, setting up three stages
for live concerts with bands and half a dozen deejays. There were no Levi's, Borders, Pepsi or
Revlon sponsorships (the sort of backing that supposedly makes high-priced festivals like Lilith
Fair "possible") but, somehow, Sydney's RTS managed to offer "three chai stalls, a food fundraiser, a skateboard skate rail, a five terminal sidewalk Internet station, two sandstone sculptors,
poets, fire twirlers, street gardeners...and loads of mayhem and frivolity."
Police reaction to the Global Street Parry varied wildly from city to city. In Sydney, the officers
stood back in awe, asking only for the sound to be turned down as the party stretched into the
evening. In Utrecht, the police were so friendly that "at one point," reports a local organizer, "they
mingled with the crowd, sat on the pavement waiting for the sound system to arrive. When it finally
arrived, they really assisted in getting the generator going." Not surprisingly, these were the
exceptions. In Toronto, at the party I attended, the police officers let the event go on for an hour,
then went into the crowd of four hundred partyers with open knives and (absurdly) began stabbing
brightly colored balloons and energetically slashing streamers. As a result, the party degenerated
into a series of incoherent cops-are-pigs skirmishes that led the six o'clock news. But Toronto's
crackdown was nothing compared with what happened in other cities. Five thousand people danced
on the streets of Geneva, but by midnight the party "had turned into a full scale riot. One car was
set alight and thousands of police charged the main encampment, firing tear-gas into the crowd.
The demonstrators smashed hundreds of windows, mainly banks and corporate offices, until 5 a.m.,
causing over half a million pounds in damage." With protestors anticipating the arrival of world
leaders and trade officials for the WTO anniversary, the rioting continued for several days.
Next time it’ll be bigger … - RTS E-mail report, Berlin, Germany, May 16, 1998

In Prague, three thousand people showed up for the Global Street Party in Wenceslaus Square,
where four sound systems were rigged up and twenty deejays were ready to play. Before long,
however, a police car drove into the crowd at full speed; the vehicle was surrounded and overturned
and once again, the rave became a riot. After organizers officially dissolved the town event, three
hundred people, mostly teens, marched through the streets of Prague, some of them stopping to hurl
rocks and bottles through the plate-glass windows of McDonald's and Kentucky Fried Chicken
outlets. More bottle throwing took place at the Berkeley, California, RTS, as well as several other
inane activities including throwing a foam mattress into a bonfire on Telegraph Avenue (creating
toxic fumes at an environmental protest —brilliant!) and smashing the window of a local
independent bookstore (way to get those corporate bad guys). The event had been billed as a
celebration of "art, love and rebellion" but police called it "a riot" —"the biggest in eight years."
There were at least twenty-seven arrests in Cambridge, four in Toronto, four in Berkeley, three in
Berlin, sixty-four in Prague, dozens in Brisbane and more than two hundred over the days of rioting
in Geneva.
Sorry, for the screw-up but since only about ten of us turned up, we decided, after a walk around town with placards
and a drummer, to bugger off to the beach for the rest of the afternoon. - RTS E-mail report, Darwin, Australia, May
16, 1998.

In several key cities, the Global Street Party was most certainly not the "fete permanente" that John
Jordan had envisioned. However, the immediate international response provoked by nothing more
than a few E-mail notices proved that there is both the potential and the desire for a truly global
protest against, the loss of public space. If anything, the urge to reclaim that space from branded life
speaks so directly to so many young people of different nationalities that its greatest liability is the
very force of the emotions it inspires.
That emotion was in full sway on May 16 in Birmingham, headquarters of the Global Street Party.
The eight most powerful politicians in the world were busy trading hockey jerseys, signing trade
agreements and —one cringes — having their own global sing-along to "All You Need Is Love."
Against that backdrop, eight thousand activists who had gathered from all over Britain gained
control of a roundabout, hooked up a sound system, played street volleyball and recaptured the RTS
spirit of celebration. As in other cities, there were confrontations with the police who surrounded
the party with a line three officers deep. This time, however, creative absurdity won out, and
instead of rocks and bottles, the weapon of choice was that increasingly popular piece of slapstick
ammo: the custard pie. And a new banner —a huge red kite —was hoisted amid the tripods, signs
and flags, bearing the names of all the cities where street parties were taking place simultaneously
in twenty countries around the world. "The resistance," one sign said, "will be as transnational as
capital."

RTS AGITPROP

The privatization of public space in the form of the car continues the erosion of neighbourhood and
community that defines the metropolis. Road schemes, business "parks," shopping developments
— all add up to the disintegration of community and the flattening of a locality. Everywhere
becomes the same as everywhere else. Community becomes commodity — a shopping village,
sedated and under constant surveillance. The desire for community is then fulfilled elsewhere,
through spectacle, sold to us in simulated form. A TV soap "street" or "square" mimicking the area
that concrete and capitalism are destroying. The real street, in this scenario, is sterile. A place to
move through not to be in. It exists only as an aid to somewhere else — through a shop window,
billboard or petrol tank.
-London RTS
What I've noticed is that all of these events and actions had one thing in common: RECLAIMING.
Whether we were reclaiming the road from cars, reclaiming buildings for squatters, reclaiming
surplus food for the homeless, reclaiming campuses as a place for protest and theatre, reclaiming
our voice from the deep dark depths of corporate media, or reclaiming our visual environment from
billboards, we were always reclaiming. Taking back what should have been ours all along. Not
"ours" as in "our club" or "our group," but ours as in the people. All the people. "Ours" as in "not
the governments" and "not the corporations."... We want power given back to the people as a
collective. We want to Reclaim the Streets.
- Toronto RTS

BAD MOOD RISING

The earth is not dying, it is being killed. And those that are killing it have names and addresses.
-Utah Phillips
How do we tell Steve that his dad owns a sweatshop?!?
— Tori Spelling, as the character Donna on Beverly Hills 90210, after discovering that her own
line of designer clothing was being manufactured by immigrant women in an L.A. sweatshop,
October 15, 1997

While the latter half of the 1990s has seen enormous growth in the brands' ubiquity, a parallel
phenomenon has emerged on the margins: a network of environmental, labour and human-rights
activists determined to expose the damage being done behind the slick veneer. Dozens of new
organizations and publications have been founded for the sole purpose of "outing" corporations that
are benefiting from repressive government policies around the globe. Older groups, previously
focused on monitoring governments, have reconfigured their mandates so that their primary role is
tracking violations committed by multinational corporations. As John Vidal, environmental editor
of The Guardian, puts it, "A lot of activists are attaching themselves leech-like onto the sides of the
bodies corporate."
This leech-like attachment takes many forms, from the socially respectable to the near-terrorist.
Since 1994, the Massachusetts-based Program on Corporations, Law & Democracy, for instance,
has been developing policy alternatives designed to "contest the authority of corporations to
govern." The Oxford-based Corporate Watch, meanwhile, focuses on researching-and helping
others to research — corporate crime. (Mot to be confused with the San Francisco-based Corporate
Watch, which sprang up at about the same time with a nearly identical mission for the U.S.)
JUSTICE. DO IT NIKE! is a group of scrappy Oregon activists devoted to haranguing Nike about
its labour practices in its own backyard. The Yellow Pages, on the other hand, is an underground
international cabal of hackers who have declared war on the computer networks of those
corporations that have successfully lobbied to delink human rights from trade with China. "In
effect, businessmen started dictating foreign policy," says Blondie Wong, director of Hong Kong
Blondes, a group of Chinese pro-democracy hackers now living in exile. "By taking the side of
profit over conscience, business has set our struggle back so far that they have become our
oppressors too."
Taking a distinctly lower-tech (some might say primitive) approach is Belgian Noel Godin and his
global band of political pie slingers. Although politicians and movie stars have faced flying pies,

the corporate sector has been the primary target: Microsoft CEO Bill Gates, Monsanto CEO Robert
Shapiro, Chevron CEO Ken Derr, World Trade Organization director Renato Ruggiero have all
been hit, as well as that architect of global free trade, Milton Friedman. "To their lies, we respond
with pies," says Agent Blueberry, of the Biotic Baking Brigade (see image, page 258).
The fad got so out of hand that in May 1999, Tesco, one of the largest supermarket chains in
England, conducted a series of tests on its pies to see which ones made for the best slinging. "We
like to keep abreast of what the customers are doing, and that's why we have to do the testing," said
company spokesperson Melodic Schuster. Her recommendation: "The custard tart gives total face
coverage." Oh, and rest assured that none of the Tesco tarts contain any ingredients that have been
genetically modified. The chain banned those from its products a month earlier —a response to a
ground-swell of Anticorporate sentiment directed at Monsanto and the other agribusiness giants.
As we will see in a later chapter, Tesco made its decision to disassociate itself from genetically
modified foods after a series of protests against "Frankenfoods" were held on its doorstep — part of
an increasingly popular strategy among activist groups. Political rallies, which once wound their
predictable course in front of government buildings and consulates, are now just as likely to take
place in front of the stores of the corporate giants: outside Nike Town (see image, page 324), Foot
Locker, the Disney Store and Shell gas pumps; on the roof of the corporate headquarters of
Monsanto or BP; through malls and around Gap outlets; and even at supermarkets.
In short, the triumph of economic globalization has inspired a wave of techno-savvy investigative
activists who are as globally minded as the corporations they track. This powerful form of activism
reaches well beyond traditional trade unions. Its members are young and old; they come from
elementary schools and college campuses suffering from branding fatigue and from church groups
with large investment portfolios worried that corporations are behaving "sinfully." They are parents
worried about their children's slavish devotion to "logo tribes," and they are also the political
intelligentsia and social marketers who are more concerned with the quality of community life than
with increased sales. In fact, by October 1997 there were so many disparate Anticorporate protests
going on around the world — against Nike, Shell, Disney, McDonald's and Monsanto - that Earth
First! printed up an impromptu calendar with all the key dates and declared it the first annual End
Corporate Dominance Month. About a month later, The Wall Street Journal ran a story headlined
"Hurry! There Are Only 27 More Protesting Days Until Christmas."

In North America, much of this activity can be traced back to 1995-96, the period that Andrew
Ross, director of American Studies at New York University, has called "The Year of the
Sweatshop." For a time that year, North Americans couldn't turn on their televisions without
hearing shameful stories about the exploitative labour practices behind the most popular, massmarketed labels on the brandscape. In August 1995, the Gap's freshly scrubbed facade was further
exfoliated to reveal a lawless factory in El Salvador where the manager responded to a union drive
by firing 150 people and vowing that "blood will flow" if organizing continued. In May 1996, U.S.
labour activists discovered that chat-show host Kathie Lee Gifford's eponymous line of sportswear
(sold exclusively at Wal-Mart) was being stitched by a ghastly combination of child labourers in
Honduras and illegal sweatshop workers in Mew York. At about the same time, Guess jeans, which
had built its image with sultry black-and-white photographs of supermodel Claudia Schiffer, was in

open warfare with the U.S. Department of Labour over a failure on the part of its California-based
contractors to pay the minimum wage. Even Mickey Mouse was letting his sweatshops show after a
Disney contractor in Haiti was caught making Pocahontas pajamas under such impoverished
conditions that workers had to nourish their babies with sugar water.
More outrage flowed after NBC aired an investigation of Mattel and Disney just days before
Christmas 1996. With the help of hidden cameras, the reporter showed that children in Indonesia
and China were working in virtual slavery "so that children in America can put frilly dresses on
America's favourite doll." In June 1996, Life magazine created more waves with photographs of
Pakistani kids —looking shockingly young and paid as little as six cents an hour —hunched over
soccer balls that bore the unmistakable Nike swoosh. But it wasn't just Nike. Adidas, Reebok,
Umbro, Mitre and Brine were all manufacturing balls in Pakistan where an estimated 10,000
children worked in the industry, many of them sold as indentured slave labourers to their employers
and branded like livestock. The Life images were so chilling that they galvanized parents, students
and educators alike, many of whom made the photographs into placards and held them up in protest
outside sporting-goods stores across the United States and Canada.
Running alongside all this was the story of Nike's sneakers. The Nike saga started before the Year
of the Sweatshop began and has only grown stronger as other corporate controversies have slipped
in and out of the public eye. Scandal has dogged Nike, with new revelations about factory
conditions trailing the company's own global flight patterns. First came the reports of union
crackdowns in South Korea; when the contractors fled and set up shop in Indonesia, the watchdogs
followed, filing stories on starvation wages and military intimidation of workers. In March 1996,
The New York Times reported that after a wildcat strike at one Javanese factory, twenty-two
workers were fired and one man who had been singled out as an organizer was locked in a room
inside the factory and interrogated by soldiers for seven days. When Nike began moving production
to Vietnam, the accusations moved too, with videotaped testimony of wage cheating and workers
being beaten over the head with shoe uppers. When production moved decisively to China, the
controversies over wages and the factories' "boot camp" style of management were right behind.
It wasn't only the superbrands and their celebrity endorsers who felt the sting of the Year of the
Sweatshop — clothing-store chains, big-box retailers and department stores also found themselves
being held responsible for the conditions under which the toys and fashions on their racks were
produced. The issue came home for America in August 1995, when an apartment complex in El
Monte, California, was raided by the U.S. Department of Labour. Seventy-two Thai garment
workers were being held in bonded slavery — some had been in the compound for as long as seven
years. The factory owner was a minor player in the industry, but the clothes the women were
sewing were sold by such retail giants as Target, Sears and Nordstrom.
It is Wal-Mart, however, that has taken it on the chin most frequently since sweatshops made their
big nineties comeback. As the world's largest retailer Wal-Mart is the primary distributor of many
of the branded goods attracting controversy: Kathie Lee Gifford's clothing line, Disney's Haitianmade pajamas, child-produced clothing from Bangladesh, sweatshop-produced toys and sports gear
from Asia. Why, consumers demanded, if Wal-Mart had the power to lower prices, alter CD covers
and influence magazine content, did it not also have the power to demand and enforce ethical
labour standards from its suppliers?

Though the revelations came out in the press one at a time, the incidents coalesced to give us a rare
look under the hood of branded America. Few liked what they saw. The unsettling combination of
celebrated brand names and impoverished production conditions have turned Nike, Disney and
Wal-Mart, among others, into powerful metaphors for a brutal new way of doing business. In a
single image, the brand-name sweatshop tells the story of the obscene disparities of the global
economy: corporate executives and celebrities raking in salaries so high they defy comprehension,
billions of dollars spent on branding and advertising — all propped up by a system of shanty-towns,
squalid factories and the misery and trampled expectations of young women like the ones I met in
Cavite, struggling to survive.

Gradually, the Year of the Sweatshop turned into the Year of the Brand Attack. Having been
introduced to the labourers behind their toys and clothing, shoppers met the people who grew their
coffee at the local Starbucks; according to the U.S. Guatemalan Labour Education Project, some of
the coffee frothed at the chain was cultivated with the use of child labour, unsafe pesticides and
sub-subsistence wages. But it was in a courtroom in London, England, that the branded world was
most thoroughly turned inside out. The highly publicized McLibel Trial began with McDonald's
1990 attempt to suppress a leaflet that accused the company of a host of abuses — from busting
unions to depleting rain forests and littering the city streets. McDonald's denied the allegations and
sued two London-based environmental activists for libel. The activists defended themselves by
subjecting McDonald's to the corporate equivalent of a colonoscopy: the case lasted for seven
years, and no infraction committed by the company was considered too minor to bring up in court
or to post on the Internet.
The McLibel defendants' allegations about food safety dovetailed with another Anticorporate
movement taking off across Europe at the same time: the campaign against Monsanto and its bioengineered agricultural crops. At the centre of this dispute was Monsanto's refusal to inform
consumers which of the foods they bought at the supermarket were the product of genetic
engineering, setting off a wave of direct action that included the uprooting of Monsanto test crops.
As if that weren't enough, multinationals also found themselves under the microscope for their
involvement with some of the world's most violent and repressive regimes: Burma, Indonesia,
Colombia, Nigeria and Chinese-occupied Tibet. The issue was by no means new, but like the
McDonald's and Monsanto campaigns, it came to a new prominence in the mid- to late nineties,
with much of the activity focusing on the host of familiar brand names operating in Burma (now
officially known as Myanmar). The bloody coup that brought the current military regime to power
in Burma took place in 1988, but international awareness about brutal conditions inside the Asian
country skyrocketed in 1995 when opposition leader and Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi was
released from six years of house arrest. In a videotaped appeal smuggled out of the country, Suu
Kyi condemned foreign investors for propping up the junta that had disregarded her party's
overwhelming election victory in 1990. Companies operating in Burma, she stated, are directly or
indirectly profiting from state-run slave-labour camps. "Foreign investors should realize there could
be no economic growth and opportunities in Burma until there is agreement on the country's
political future."

The first response from human-rights activists was to lobby governments in North America, Europe
and Scandinavia to impose trade sanctions on the Burmese government. When this failed to halt the
flow of trade, they began targeting individual companies based in the activists' own home countries.
In Denmark, the protests centred on the national brewer, Carlsberg, which had entered into a large
contract to build a brewery in Burma. In Holland, the target was Heineken; in the U.S. and Canada,
Liz Claiborne, Unocal, Disney, Pepsi and Ralph Lauren were in the crosshairs.
But the most significant landmark in the growth of Anticorporate activism also came in 1995, when
the world lost Ken Saro-Wiwa. The revered Nigerian writer and environmental leader was
imprisoned by his country's oppressive regime for spearheading the Ogoni people's campaign
against the devastating human and ecological effects of Royal Dutch/Shell's oil drilling in the Niger
Delta. Human-rights groups rallied their governments to interfere, and some economic sanctions
were imposed, but they had little effect. In November 1995, Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni
activists were executed by a military government who had enriched themselves with Shell's oil
money and through their own people's repression.
The Year of the Brand Attack stretched into two years, then three and now shows no sign of
receding. In February 1999, a new report revealed that workers sewing Disney clothes in several
Chinese factories were earning as little as 13.5 cents an hour and were forced to put in hours of
overtime. In May 1999, ABC's 20/20 returned to the island of Saipan and brought back footage of
young women locked inside sweatshop factories sewing for the Gap, Tommy Hilfiger and Polo
Ralph Lauren. New revelations have also come out about violent clashes surrounding Chevron's
drilling activities in the Niger Delta, and about Talisman Energy's plans to drill on contested
territory in war-torn Sudan.
The volume and the tenacity of public outrage directed against them has blindsided the
corporations, in large part because the activities for which they were being condemned were not
particularly new. McDonald's has never been a friend of the working poor; oil companies have a
long and uninterrupted history of collaborating with repressive governments to extract valuable
resources with little concern for the people who live near them; Nike has produced its sneakers in
Asian sweatshops since the early seventies, and many of the clothing chains have been doing so for
even longer. As The Wall Street Journal's Bob Ortega writes, labour unions had been collecting
evidence of child labourers in Bangladesh making clothing sold at Wal-Mart since 1991, "But even
though the unions had photos of children on the assembly lines...the accusations didn't get much
play, in print or on television."
Obviously much of the current focus on corporate abuses has to do with the tenacity of activists
organizing around these issues. But since so many of the abuses being highlighted have been going
on for decades, the current groundswell of resistance raises the question, Why now? Why did 199596 become the Year of the Sweatshop, turning quickly into the Years of the Brand Attack? Why not
1976, 1984, 1988, or, perhaps most relevant of all, why not 1993? It was in May of that year that
the Kader toy factory in Bangkok burned to the ground. The building was a textbook firetrap, and
when the piles of plush fabric ignited, the flames raced through the locked factory, killing 188
workers and injuring 469 more. Kader was the worst fire in industrial history, taking more lives
than the Triangle Shirtwaist Company fire that killed 146 young workers in New York City in
1911. The parallels between Triangle and Kader —separated from each other by half a world, and

eighty-two years of so-called development — are chilling: it was as if time hadn't moved forward,
but had simply shifted locations.
At Triangle, as at Kader, the workers were almost all young women — some as young as fourteen,
but most about nineteen. A report issued after the Triangle fire found that most of the dead were
Italian and Russian immigrants, and almost half had come to America ahead of their families,
seeking employment to subsidize the journeys of parents and siblings - so similar to the situation of
the migrant peasant girls who perished at Kader. Like the Kader factory, the Triangle building was
an accident waiting to happen, complete with fake fire exits, mounds of flammable material and
doors that stayed locked all day to keep out the union organizers. Like the young women at Kader,
many of the girls at Triangle wrapped themselves in cloth and jumped out the factory windows to
their deaths — that way, they reasoned, their families would at least be able to identify their bodies.
A New York World reporter described the gruesome Triangle scene. "Suddenly something that
looked like a bale of dark dress goods was hurled from an eighth-story window....Then another
seeming bundle of cloth came hurtling through the same window, but this time a breeze tossed open
the cloth and from the crowd of five hundred persons came a cry of horror. The breeze disclosed the
form of a girl shooting down to instant death."
The Triangle Shirtwaist Company fire was the defining incident of the first anti-sweatshop
movement in the United States. It catalyzed hundreds of thousands of workers into militancy and
promoted a government response that eventually led to a fifty-four-hour weekly cap on overtime,
no work past 9 p.m. and breakthroughs in health and fire regulations. Perhaps the most significant
advance as a result of the fire was the introduction of what today would be called independent
monitoring — the founding of the New York Factory Investigation Commission, which was
authorized to stage surprise raids on suspected sweatshop operators.
So what did the 188 deaths in the Kader fire accomplish? Sadly, despite the fact that several
international labour and development groups stepped in to denounce the unlawful factory operator,
Kader didn't become a symbol of the desperate need for reform the way Triangle Shirtwaist had
done. In One World, Ready or Not, William Greider describes visiting Thailand and meeting
victims and activists who had been fighting hard for retribution. "Some of them were under the
impression that a worldwide boycott of Kader products was underway, organized by consciencestricken Americans and Europeans. I had to inform them that the civilized world had barely noticed
their tragedy.... A fire in Bangkok was like a typhoon in Bangladesh, an earthquake in Turkey."
Little wonder, then, that only six months after Kader, another devastating sweatshop fire —this one
at the Zhili toy factory in Shenzhen, China — took the lives of another 87 young workers.
At the time, it didn't seem to register with the international community that the toys the Kader
women had been sewing were destined for the joyful aisles of Toys 'R' Us, to be wrapped and
placed under Christmas trees in Europe, the United States and Canada. Many news reports failed
even to mention the names of the brands being stitched in the factory. As Greider writes, "The
Kader fire might have been more meaningful for Americans if they could have seen the thousands
of soot-stained dolls that spilled from the wreckage, macabre litter scattered among the dead. Bugs
Bunny, Bart Simpson and the Muppets. Big Bird and other Sesame Street dolls. Playskool 'Water
Pets.'"

But in 1993 few people in the West —and certainly not in the Western media —were ready to make
the connection between the burned-out building in Bangkok, buried on page six or ten of their
newspapers, and the brand-name toys filling North American and European homes. That is no
longer the case today. What happened in 1995 was a kind of collective "click" on the part of both
the media and the public. The cumulative response to the horror stories of Chinese prison labour,
the scenes of teenage girls being paid pennies in the Mexican maquiladoras, and burning in fires in
Bangkok, has been a slow but noticeable shift in how people in the West see workers in the
developing world. "They're getting our jobs" is giving way to a more humane reaction: "Our
corporations are stealing their lives."
Much of this has to do with timing. Concerns expressed about child labour in India and Pakistan
had remained at the level of a steady drone for more than a decade. But by 1995, the question of
linking trade policies to human rights had been pushed so far off most governments' agendas that
when thirteen-year-old Craig Kielburger deliberately disrupted Canadian prime minister Jean
Chretien's trade mission to India to talk about the children who were working there in bonded
slavery, the issue seemed urgent and exotic. Moreover, in North America, the total usurpation of
foreign policy by the free-trade agenda invited disruption — the world was ready to listen.
The same is true of corporate crime in general. It may be nothing new for consumer goods to be
produced under oppressive conditions, but what clearly is new is the tremendously expanded role
consumer-goods companies are playing in our culture. Anticorporate activism is on the rise because
many of us feel the international brand-name connections that crisscross the globe more keenly than
we ever have before — and we feel them precisely because we have never been as "branded" as we
are today.
Branding, as we have seen, has taken a fairly straightforward relationship between buyer and seller
and - through the quest to turn brands into media providers, arts producers, town squares and social
philosophers — transformed it into something much more invasive and profound. For the past
decade, multinationals like Nike, Microsoft and Starbucks have sought to become the chief
communicators of all that is good and cherished in our culture: art, sports, community, connection,
equality. But the more successful this project is, the more vulnerable these companies become: if
brands are indeed intimately entangled with our culture and our identities, when they do wrong,
their crimes are not dismissed as merely the misdemeanours of another corporation trying to make a
buck. Instead, many of the people who inhabit their branded worlds feel complicit in their wrongs,
both guilty and connected. But this connection is a volatile one: it is not the old-style loyalty
between lifelong employee and corporate boss; rather, this is a connection more akin to the
relationship of fan and celebrity: emotionally intense but shallow enough to turn on a dime.
This volatility is the unintended consequence of brand managers striving for unprecedented
intimacy with the consumer while forging a more casual role with the workforce. In reaching
brand-not-products nirvana, these companies have lost two things that may prove more precious in
the long run: consumer detachment from their global activities and citizen investment in their
economic success.
It has taken us a while, but if another Kader happened tomorrow, the first question journalists
would ask would be, "What toys were being produced?" "Where were they being shipped?" and
"Which companies hired the contractors?" Labour activists in Thailand would be in instant

communication with solidarity groups in Hong Kong, Washington, Berlin, Amsterdam, Sydney,
London and Toronto. E-mails would be fired off from Washington-based Campaign for Labour
Rights, from the Clean Clothes Campaign out of Amsterdam, and forwarded through a network of
Web sites, listserves and fax trees. The National Labour Committee, UNITE!, the Labour Behind
the Label Coalition and the World Development Movement would be organizing protests outside
Toys 'R' Us, shouting, "Our children don't need bloodstained toys!" University students would dress
up as the cartoon characters of their childhood and hand out pamphlets comparing Bugs Bunny's
payout for Space Jam to the cost of putting in a fire exit at Kader. Meetings would be scheduled
with national associations of toy manufacturers; new and tougher codes of conduct would be
highlighted for consideration. The public mind is not only able but eager to make the global
connections that William Greider searched for but did not find after the Kader fire.
Though Anticorporate activism is seeing a renewal unparalleled since the thirties, there have, of
course, been some significant Anticorporate campaigns scattered between the thirties and their
present-day revival. The granddaddy of modern brand-based actions is the boycott against Nestle,
which peaked in the late seventies. The campaign targeted the Swiss company for its aggressive
marketing of costly baby formula as a "safer" alternative to breast-feeding in the developing world.
The Nestle case has a strong parallel with the McLibel Trial (to be discussed in detail in Chapter
16), largely because the issue didn't really capture the world's attention until the food company
made the mistake of suing a Swiss activist group for libel in 1976.'2 As with McLibel, the ensuing
court case put Nestle under intense scrutiny and led to an international boycott campaign, launched
in 1977.
The eighties saw the largest industrial accident in human history: a massive toxic leak in 1984 at a
Union Carbide pesticide factory in Bhopal, India, killed two thousand people immediately and has
taken five thousand more lives in the years since. Today, graffiti on the wall of the dilapidated and
abandoned factory reads "Bhopal = Hiroshima." Despite this tragedy, widely recognized to be the
result of weak safety precautions including a switched-off alarm system, the eighties were a dry
spell for most political movements that questioned the beneficial power of capital. Although there
was a broad recognition during the Central American wars that U.S. multinationals were propping
up various dictatorships, solidarity work in North America focused primarily on the actions of
governments, as opposed to multinational corporations. As one report on the subject notes,
"attacking [corporations] tended to be seen as a hangover from the 'silly seventies.'"
There was, however, one major exception to this rule: the anti-apartheid movement. Frustrated by
the international community's refusal to impose meaningful trade sanctions on South Africa, antiapartheid activists developed a series of alternative roadblocks designed, if not to prevent
multinationals from profiting from the racist regime, at least to inconvenience them if they persisted
in doing so. Students and faculty members at several universities set up tent cities demanding that
schools divest themselves of their endowments from any company doing business with the African
nation. Church groups disrupted corporate shareholder meetings with demands for immediate
withdrawal, while more moderate investors pushed corporate boards to adopt the Sullivan
principles — a set of rules for companies in South Africa that purported to minimize their
complicity with the apartheid regime. Meanwhile, trade unions pulled their pensions and bank
accounts from institutions issuing loans to the South African government, and dozens of municipal
governments passed selective purchasing agreements cancelling large contracts with companies
invested in South Africa. The most creative blockades were erected by the international trade-union

movement. Several times a year, the unions would call a day of action, during which dock workers
refused to unload cargo that had come from South Africa, and airline ticket agents refused to book
flights to and from Johannesburg. In the words of campaign organizer Ken Luckhardt, workers
became "activists at the point of production."
Though there are definite similarities, there is one key difference between the apartheid actions and
the kind of Anticorporate campaigning gaining momentum today. The South Africa boycott was an
antiracist campaign that happened to use trade (whether the importing of wine or the exporting of
General Motors dollars) as a tool to bring down the South African political system. Many of the
current Anticorporate campaigns are also rooted in a political attack-but what they are attacking is
as much a global economic system as a national political one. During the years of apartheid,
companies such as the Royal Bank of Canada, Barclays Bank in England and General Motors were
generally regarded as morally neutral forces that happened to be entangled with an aberrantly racist
government. Today, more and more campaigners are treating multinationals, and the policies that
give them free rein, as the root cause of political injustices around the globe. Sometimes the
companies commit these violations in collusion with governments, sometimes they commit them
despite a government's best efforts.
This systemic critique has been embraced, in recent years, by several established human-rights
groups like Amnesty International, PEN and Human Rights Watch, as well as environmental rights
organizations like the Sierra Club. For many of these organizations, this represents a significant
shift in policy. Until the mid-eighties foreign corporate investment in the Third World was seen in
the mainstream development community as a key to alleviating poverty and misery. By 1996,
however, that concept was being openly questioned, and it was recognized that many governments
in the developing world were protecting lucrative investments — mines, dams, oil fields, power
plants and export processing zones —by deliberately turning a blind eye to egregious rights
violations by foreign corporations against their people. And in the enthusiasm for increased trade,
the Western nations where most of these offending corporations were based also chose to look the
other way, unwilling to risk their own global competitiveness for some other country's problems.
The bottom line was that in parts of Asia, Central and South America and Africa, the promise that
investment would bring greater freedom and democracy was starting to look like a cruel hoax. And
worse: in case after case, foreign corporations were found to be soliciting, even directly contracting,
the local police and military to perform such unsavoury tasks as evicting peasants and tribes people
from their land; cracking down on striking factory workers; and arresting and killing peaceful
protestors — all in the name of safeguarding the smooth flow of trade. Corporations, in other
words, were stunting human development, rather than contributing to it.
Arvind Ganesan, a researcher with Human Rights Watch, is blunt about what his organization
refers to as "a shift in the terms of the debate over corporate responsibility for human rights."
Rather than improved human rights flowing from increased trade, "governments ignore human
rights in favour of perceived trade advantages." Ganesan points out that the severing of the
connection between investment and human-rights improvements is today clearest in Nigeria, where
the long-awaited transition to democracy has been coupled with a renewed wave of military
brutality against Niger Delta communities protesting against the oil companies.
Amnesty International, in a departure from its focus on prisoners persecuted for either their
religious or political beliefs, is also beginning to treat multinational corporations as major players in

the denial of human rights worldwide. More and more, recent Amnesty reports have found that
people such as the late Ken Saro-Wiwa have been persecuted for what a government sees as a
destabilizing Anticorporate stance. In a 1997 report, the group documents the fact that Indian
villagers and tribal peoples were violently arrested, and some killed, for peacefully resisting the
development of private power plants and luxury hotels on their lands. A democratic country, in
other words, was becoming less democratic as a result of corporate intervention. "Development,"
Amnesty warned, is "being pursued at the expense of human rights...."
This pattern highlights the degree to which the central and state authorities in India are prepared
to deploy state force and utilize provisions of the law in the interests of development projects,
curtailing the right of freedom of association, expression and assembly. India's moves to liberalize
its economy and develop new industries and infrastructure have in many areas marginalized and
displaced communities and contributed to further violations of their human rights.
India's situation, the report states, is not "the only or the worst" one, but is part of a trend toward the
disregarding of human rights in favour of "development" in the global economy.

At the heart of this convergence of Anticorporate activism and research is the recognition that
corporations are much more than purveyors of the products we all want; they are also the most
powerful political forces of our time. By now, we've all heard the statistics: how corporations like
Shell and Wal-Mart bask in budgets bigger than the gross domestic product of most nations; how,
of the top hundred economies, fifty-one are multinationals and only forty-nine are countries. We
have read (or heard about) how a handful of powerful CEOs are writing the new rules for the global
economy, engineering what Canadian writer John Ralston Saul has called "a coup d'etat in slow
motion." In his book about corporate power, Silent Coup, Tony Clark takes this theory one step
further when he argues that citizens must go after corporations not because we don't like their
products, but because corporations have become the ruling political bodies of our era, setting the
agenda of globalization. We must confront them, in other words, because that is where the power is.
So although the media often describe campaigns like the one against Nike as "consumer boycotts,"
that tells only part of the story. It is more accurate to describe them as political campaigns that use
consumer goods as readily accessible targets, as public-relations levers and as popular-education
tools. In contrast to the consumer boycotts of the seventies, there is a more diffuse relationship
between lifestyle choices (what to eat, what to smoke, what to wear) and the larger questions of
how the global corporation — its size, political clout and lack of transparency - is reorganizing the
world economy. Behind the protests outside Nike Town, behind the pie in Bill Gates's face and the
bottle shattering the McDonald's window in Prague, there is something too visceral for most
conventional measures to track — a kind of bad mood rising. And the corporate hijacking of
political power is as responsible for this mood as the brands' cultural looting of public and mental
space. I also like to think it has to do with the arrogance of branding itself: the seeds of discontent
are part of its very DNA.

"Look, Mike, there's a real market for the truth about Nike.... Our debut product will be a
proprietary database of Nike labour abuses! I see a Web presence and a CD-ROM of stats, worker
affidavits, human rights reports and hidden camera video clips."
"Kind of niche product, isn't it, babe?"
"No. This will be huge!"™
So goes an exchange in Gary Trudeau's Doonesbury cartoon strip — and it's a joke with a strong
sting to it. The continuing attacks on brands like Nike, Shell and McDonald's not only reflect
genuine indignation at sweatshops, oil spills and corporate censorship, they also reflect how large
the antagonistic audience has become. The desire (and ability) to back up free-floating anticorporate malaise with legitimate facts, figures and real-life anecdotes is so widespread that it even
transcends old rivalries within the social and ecological movements. The United Food and
Commercial Workers' union, which started targeting Wal-Mart because of its low wages and unionbusting tactics, now collects and disseminates information on Wal-Mart stores being built on sacred
Native burial grounds. Since when did a grocery-store workers' union weigh in on indigenous land
claims? Since puncturing Wal-Mart became a cause in and of itself. Why did the London ecoanarchists behind the McLibel Trial —who don't believe in working for the Man in any form -take
up the plight of teenage McDonald's workers? Because, for them, it's another angle from which to
attack the golden beast.
The political backdrop to this phenomenon is well known. Many citizens' movements have tried to
reverse conservative economic trends over the last decade by electing liberal, labour or democraticsocialist governments, only to find that economic policy remains unchanged or caters even more
directly to the whims of global corporations. Centuries of democratic reforms that had won greater
transparency in government suddenly appeared ineffective in the new climate of multinational
power. What good was an open and accountable Parliament or Congress if opaque corporations
were setting so much of the global political agenda in the back rooms?
Disillusionment with the political process has been even more pronounced on the international
stage, where attempts to regulate multinationals through the United Nations and trade regulatory
bodies have been blocked at every turn. A significant setback came in 1986 when the U.S.
government effectively killed the little-known United Nations Commission on Transnational
Corporations. Started in the mid-seventies, the commission set out to draft a universal code of
conduct for multinational corporations. Its goals were preventing corporate abuses such as
companies dumping, in the Third World, drugs that are illegal in the West; examining the
environmental and labour impacts of export factories and resource extraction; and pushing the
private sector toward greater transparency and accountability.
The merit of these goals seems self-evident today but the commission, in many ways, was a
casualty of its time. American industry was opposed to its creation from the start and in the heat of
Cold War mania managed to secure their government's withdrawal on the grounds that the
commission was a Communist plot and that the Soviets were using it for espionage. Why, they
demanded, were Soviet-bloc national enterprises not subject to the same probing as American
companies? During this era, criticisms of the abuses of multinational corporations were so bound
up in anti-Communist paranoia that when the Bhopal tragedy happened in 1984, the immediate
response of a U.S. embassy official in New Delhi was not to express horror but to say, "This is a
feast for the Communists. They'll go with it for weeks."

More recently, attempts to force the World Trade Organization to include enforcement of basic
labour laws as a condition of global trade have been dismissed by member nations who insist such
enforcement is the job of the UN's International Labour Organization. The 1LO "is the competent
body to determine and deal with these standards, and we affirm our support for its work in
promoting them," states the WTO's Singapore Ministerial Declaration of December 13, 1996.
However, when the 1LO embarked on an initiative to draft a meaningful corporate code of conduct,
it too was blocked.
At first, these failures to regulate capital left many reform and opposition movements in a state of
near-paralysis: citizens, it seemed, had lost their say. Slowly, however, a handful of
nongovernmental organizations and groups of progressive intellectuals have been developing a
political strategy that recognizes that multinational brands, because of their high profile, can be far
more galvanizing targets than the politicians whom they bankroll. And once the corporations are
feeling the heat, they have learned, it becomes much easier to get the attention of elected
politicians. In explaining why he has chosen to focus his activism on the Nike corporation,
Washington-based labour activist Jeff Ballinger says bluntly, "Because we have more influence on
a brand name than we do with our own governments." Besides, adds John Vidal, "Activists always
target the people who have the power...so if the power moves from government to industry to
transnational corporations, so the swivel will move onto these people."
Already, a common imperative is emerging from the disparate movements taking on multinational
corporations: the people's right to know. If multinationals have become larger and more powerful
than governments, the argument goes, then why shouldn't they be subject to the same accountability
controls and transparency that we demand of our public institutions? So anti-sweatshop activists
have been demanding that Wal-Mart hand over lists of all the factories around the world that supply
the chain with finished products. University students, as we will see in Chapter 17, are demanding
the same information about factories that produce clothing with their school insignia.
Environmentalists, meanwhile, have used the courts to X-ray the inner working of McDonald's.
And all over the world, consumers are demanding that companies like Monsanto provide clear
labelling of genetically modified food and open their research to outside scrutiny.
Placing demands like these on private companies, whose only legal duty is to their shareholders,
has generated a surprising number of successes. The reason is that many multinationals have a
rather sizable weak spot. As we will see in the next chapter, activists around the world are making
liberal use of the very factor that has been the subject of this book so far: the brand. Brand image,
the source of so much corporate wealth, is also, it turns out, the corporate Achilles' heel.

It can take 100 years to build up a good brand and 30 days to knock it down.
-David D'Alessandro, president of John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance, January 6, 1999

Branding, as we have seen, is a balloon economy: it inflates with astonishing rapidity but it is full
of hot air. It shouldn't be surprising that this formula has bred armies of pin-wielding critics, eager
to pop the corporate balloon and watch the shreds fall to the ground. The more ambitious a
company has been in branding the cultural landscape, and the more careless it has been in
abandoning workers, the more likely it is to have generated a silent battalion of critics waiting to
pounce. Moreover, the branding formula leaves corporations wide open to the most obvious tactic
in the activist arsenal: bringing a brand's production secrets crashing into its marketing image. It's a
tactic that has worked before.

Though marketing and production have not always been separated by so many bodies of water and
layers of subcontractors, the two have never been exactly cozy. Ever since the first ad campaigns
created folksy mascots to lend a homemade feel to mass-produced goods, it has been the very
business of the advertising industry to distance products from the factories that make them. Helen
Woodward, an influential copywriter in the 1920s, famously warned her co-workers that "if you are
advertising any product, never see the factory in which it was made.... Don't watch the people at
work... because, you see, when you know the truth about anything, the real inner truth — it is very
hard to write the surface fluff which sells it."'
Back then, Dickensian images like those from the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire were still fresh in the
minds of Western consumers. They didn't need to be reminded of the dark side of industrialization
when they were buying soap, stockings, cars or any other product that promised happiness in the
self and envy in everybody else. Besides, many of the consumers being targeted by advertising
were themselves factory workers, and the last thing a fluff writer wanted to do was trigger a
memory of the dreary monotony of the assembly line.
But as First World countries have shifted into "information economies," we have developed a
certain nostalgia for the gritty authenticity of Woodward's era of industrialization. And so the
factory, long marketing's greatest taboo, has recently found a place in advertising. The shop floor is
featured in Saturn car ads, for example, where we meet empowered auto workers who can "stop the
line" just because something looks a little dodgy. Interior shots of a factory also briefly appear in an
early nineties Subaru ad — there to make the trademark Wieden & Kennedy point that cars really
aren't about impressing your neighbours but driving "the best machine."
However, the factories featured in both the Saturn and Subaru campaigns aren't the sweat shop floor
that Woodward warned her fellow ad writers to never lay eyes upon; these are New Age nostalgia
factories — about as realistic as Intel's dancing techno-technicians. The role of these factories, like
that of Aunt Jemima and the Quaker Oats mascot, is to associate Subaru and Saturn with a simpler
time, a time when goods were made in the countries where they were consumed, when people still
knew their neighbours and nobody had heard of an export processing zone. In the early nineties, at
a time when car factories were closing in droves and the market was being flooded with cheap
imports, the ads — though purporting to take us behind the glitz of advertising — were there not to
illuminate the manufacturing process, but to obscure it.
In other words, Helen Woodward's rule holds truer now than ever: at no point has the double life of
our branded goods been more conflicted. Despite the rhetoric of One Worldism, the planet remains
sharply divided between producers and consumers, and the enormous profits raked in by the
superbrands are premised upon these worlds remaining as separate from each other as possible. It is
a tidy formula: because the contract factory owners in the free-trade zones don't sell a single
Reebok sneaker or Mickey Mouse sweatshirt directly to the public, they have a limitless threshold
for bad public relations. Building up a positive relationship with the shopping public, meanwhile, is
left entirely in the hands of the brand-name multinationals. The only catch is that for the system to
function smoothly, workers must know little of the marketed lives of the products they produce and
consumers must remain sheltered from the production lives of the brands they buy.

The formula has worked for quite a while. For the first two decades of their existence, export
processing zones were indeed globalization's dirty little secret — secured "labour warehouses"
where the unsightly business of production was contained behind high walls and barbed wire. But
the "brands, not products" mania that has gripped the business world since the early nineties is
coming back to haunt the free-floating, incorporeal corporation. And no wonder. Severing brands
so decisively from their sites of production and shuttling factories away into the industrial hellholes
of the EPZs has created a potentially explosive situation. It's as if the global production chain is
based on the belief that workers in the South and consumers in the North will never figure out a
way to communicate with each other — that despite the info-tech hype, only corporations are
capable of genuine global mobility. It is this supreme arrogance that has made brands like Nike and
Disney so vulnerable to the two principal tactics employed by Anticorporate campaigners: exposing
the riches of the branded world to the tucked-away sites of production and bringing back the
squalor of production to the doorstep of the blinkered consumer.

I'm sitting in a crowded classroom in Berkeley, California, and somebody is turning up my collar to
see the label. For a moment, I feel as if I am back in grade school with Romi the logo vigilante
checking for impostors. Instead, it's 1997 and the person examining my collar is Lora Jo Foo,
president of Sweatshop Watch. She is running a seminar called "Ending Sweatshops at Home and
Abroad" as part of a conference on globalization. Every time Foo runs a seminar on sweatshops,
she pulls out a pair of scissors and asks everyone to cut the labels off their clothing. She then
unfurls a map of the world made of white cloth. Our liberated brand names are sewn onto the map,
which, over the course of many such gatherings in several countries, has become a crazy patchwork
quilt of Liz Claiborne, Banana Republic, Victoria's Secret, Gap, Jones New York, Calvin Klein and
Ralph Lauren logos. Most of the dense little rectangular patches are concentrated in Asia and Latin
America. Foo then traces a company's global travel routes: she begins with when its products were
still being produced in North America (only a few labels remain on that part of the map); then
moves to Japan and South Korea; then to Indonesia and the Philippines; then to China and Vietnam.
According to Foo, clothing logos make a great teaching aid; they take faraway, complex issues and
plant them as close to home as the clothes on our backs.
It must be said that no one is more surprised by the power and appeal of brand-based activism than
those who have spearheaded the campaigns. Many of the people leading the anti-sweatshop
movement are long-time advocates on behalf of the Third World's poor and marginalized. In the
eighties, they plugged away in near-total obscurity on behalf of Nicaragua's Sandinista rebels and
El Salvador's FMLN opposition party. After the wars ended and the pace of globalization
accelerated, they learned that the new war zone for Central America's poor was the sweatshop
factory locked inside the military-guarded free-trade zone. But what they weren't prepared for was
how sympathetic the public would be to this problem. "I think that what gives this issue such
widespread appeal —makes it so much more real to people than the Central American wars were —
is that people make a direct connection with their own lives; it's no longer something that's 'out
there,'" says Trim Bissell of the Washington-based Campaign for Labour Rights. "If they eat at one
of those chain outlets, they may well be putting into their bodies food that in one way or another
depends on the oppression of someone else. If they buy toys for their children, those toys may have
been made by children who have no childhood. It is so direct and so emotional and so human that
people contact us and say 'How can I help?' In this work, we're not having to say 'There's a

problem.' We're mostly saying, 'Here's a productive way you can direct your outrage.'" American
author Lorraine Dusky described the dynamics of this personal connection in USA Today.
Watching TV reports of the May 1998 riots in Indonesia, she found herself wondering whether her
logos had anything to do with a young Indonesian girl shown wailing over the dead body of a fire
victim. "Were my Nikes somehow to blame?" she writes. "That bereft young girl might still have a
father if Nike had insisted that workers be better paid. Because if Nike had, other sweatshop
employers might have followed suit." It may seem like a leap —blaming one's sneakers for a death
in an Indonesian pro-democracy protest - but it did provide the connection necessary, as Dusky
writes, to see that "globalization means more than the easy exchange of currency and goods; it
means that we are all our sisters' and brothers' keepers."
But while the effectiveness of brand-based campaigns may be in their immediate relevance to our
own branded lives, there is another factor contributing to their appeal, particularly among young
people. Anticorporate activism enjoys the priceless benefits of borrowed hipness and celebrity —
borrowed, ironically enough, from the brands themselves. Logos that have been burned into our
brains by the finest image campaigns money can buy, and lifted a little closer to the sun by their
sponsorship of much-loved cultural events, are perpetually bathed in a glow — the "loglo," to
borrow a term from science fiction writer Neal Stevenson. As Alexis de Tocqueville predicted, it is
fantastical creations like this that have the power to make us "regret the world of reality" — and no
reality has come to seem more comparatively regrettable than that of people suffering under
poverty and oppression in faraway places. So in the late seventies, as the loglo grew brighter,
social-justice activism faded; its woefully unmarketable ways no longer held much appeal for
energetic young people or for media obsessed with slick aesthetics.
But today, with so many Anticorporate activists adopting the aesthetics and humour of culture
jamming and the irreverent attitude of street reclaiming, that is beginning to change. From their
new "leech-like" vantage point, the brands' detractors are benefiting from the loglo in an
unanticipated way. The loglo is so bright that activists are able to enjoy its light, even as they are in
the act of attacking a brand. This vicarious branding may seem to some like an erosion of their
political purity but it also clearly helps to lure foot soldiers to the cause. Like a good ad bust,
Anticorporate campaigns draw energy from the power and mass appeal of marketing, at the same
time as they hurl that energy right back at the brands that have so successfully colonized our
everyday lives.
You can see this jujitsu strategy in action in what has become a staple of many Anticorporate
campaigns: inviting a worker from a Third World country to come visit a First World superstore —
with plenty of cameras rolling. Few newscasts can resist the made-for-TV moment when an
Indonesian Nike worker gasps as she learns that the sneakers she churned out for $2 a day sell for
$120 at San Francisco Nike Town. Since 1994, there have been at least five separate tours of
Indonesian Nike workers through North America and Europe — Cicih Sukaesih, who lost her job
for trying to organize a union in a Nike factory, has been back three times, her trips sponsored by
coalitions of labour, church and school groups. In August 1995, two Gap seamstresses —
seventeen-year-old Claudia Leticia Molina from Honduras and eighteen-year-old Judith Yanira
Viera from El Salvador— went on similar North American speaking tours, addressing crowds
outside dozens of Gap outlets. Perhaps most memorably, shoppers were able to put a face to the
issue of child labour when fifteen-year-old Wendy Diaz appeared before the U.S. Congress. She
had been working in a Honduran factory sewing Kathie Lee Gifford pants since she was thirteen.

Diaz testified to the presence of "about 100 minors like me — thirteen, fourteen, fifteen years old
— some even twelve.... Sometimes they kept us all night long, working.... The supervisors scream
at us and yell at us to work faster. Sometimes they throw the garment in your face, or grab and
shove you.... Sometimes the managers touch the girls. Pretending it's a joke they touch our legs.
Many of us would like to go to night school but we can't because they constantly force us to work
overtime."
No group has taken advantage of the branding economy's various leaks and cracks with more laserlike accuracy than the National Labour Committee, under its director, Charles Kernaghan. In the
five years between 1994 and 1999, the NLC's three-person office in New York has used
Greenpeace-style media antics to draw more public attention to the plight of sweatshop workers
than the multimillion-dollar international trade union movement has achieved in almost a century.
As the garment-industry bible Women's Wear Daily put it, "Charles Kernaghan and his antisweatshop battle have been shaking up the issue of labour abuses in the apparel industry like
nothing since the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire."
The NLC didn't achieve this rather remarkable feat by lobbying government or even by organizing
workers. It did it by setting out to sully some of the most polished logos on the brandscape.
Kernaghan's formula is simple enough. First, select America's most cartoonish icons, from literal
ones like Mickey Mouse to virtual ones like Kathie Lee Gifford. Next, create head-on collisions
between image and reality. "They live or die by their image," Kernaghan says of his corporate
adversaries. "That gives you a certain power over them ...these companies are sitting ducks."
Like the best culture jammers, Kernaghan has a natural feel for the pitch. He knew that he could
"sell" overseas sweatshops to the U.S. media-notorious for its double-jeopardy bias against labour
and problems in places where people don't speak English. But what he needed to do was steer clear
of obscure labour laws and arcane trade agreements, and keep the focus squarely on the logos
behind the violations. It's a formula that has brought the sweatshop story under serious scrutiny on
60 Minutes and 20/20 and in The New York Times — and ultimately even to Hard Copy, which
sent a crew to accompany Kernaghan on a tour of Nicaraguan sweatshops in fall 1997.
The tabloid news show and the gutsy labour group didn't make as strange bedfellows as one might
think. We are a celebrity-obsessed culture, and such a culture is never in finer form than when one
of its most loved icons is mired in scandal. What Kernaghan had seized upon is that the fanatical
obsession with logos extends not only to building them up, but also to tearing them down. Though
on a vastly different scale, Nike's sweatshops are to labour reporting what OJ. Simpson's trial was
to the legal beat: designer dirt. And the NLC, for better or for worse (definitely for worse, say its
critics), is indeed the Hard Copy of the labour movement, forever searching out that intersection
between the dazzling celebrity stratosphere and real life on the mean streets.
So Kernaghan lays out the facts and figures of the global economy in Disney pajamas, Mike
running shoes, Wal-Mart aisles and the personal riches of the individuals involved — and crunches
the numbers into homemade statistical contraptions that he then wields like a mallet. For example:
all 50,000 workers at the Yue Yen Nike Factory in China would have to work for nineteen years to
earn what Nike spends on advertising in one year. Wal-Mart's annual sales are worth 120 times
more than Haiti's entire annual budget; Disney CEO Michael Eisner earns $9,783 an hour while a

Haitian worker earns 28 cents an hour; it would take a Haitian worker 16.8 years to earn Eisner's
hourly income; the $181 million in stock options Eisner exercised in 1996 is enough to take care of
his 19,000 Haitian workers and their families for fourteen years.
A typical Kernaghanism is to compare and contrast the plush living conditions of the dogs on the
set of 101 Dalmatians with the shacks in which the Haitian workers live who sewed Disney
pajamas decorated with the movie's characters. The animals, he says, stayed in "doggie condos"
fitted with cushy beds and heat lamps, were cared for by on-call vets and served beef and chicken.
The Haitian workers live in malaria- and dysentery-infested hovels, sleep on cots and can rarely
afford to buy meat or go to the doctor. It is in this collision between the life of brand and the reality
of production that Kernaghan works his own marketing magic.
The NLC's events — far from the usual grey labour rallies — take full advantage of the powers of
the loglo. An October 1997 rally in New York City was a case in point: it began in Times Square
across from Disney's flagship superstore, proceeded along Seventh Avenue, past Macy's Tommy
Hilfiger window display, past Barnes 8t Noble, and Stern's department store. As the kick-off of
"The Holiday Season of Conscience," the rally had as visual backdrop for the chants and speeches
Manhattan's most enormous logos: a giant red swoosh on the skyline, the Maxell guy in his
armchair getting "blown away" by digital sound and 3-D displays for The Lion King on Broadway.
When Jay Mazur, president of UNITE, pronounced that "sweatshops are back and we know why,"
he did so with a towering, neon-lit Little Mermaid forming a halo over his head. At another NLCsponsored protest, this one in March 1999, participants parked a giant rubber rat outside the Disney
store. And because Kernaghan's tactics don't demand pop-cultural asceticism in exchange for
participation, they have proven hugely appealing to students, many of whom show up for these
rallies as walking culture jams. Echoing the cartoonish aesthetics of rave culture, high-school kids
and college students dress in fuzzy animal costumes: a six-foot pink pig holding up a sign that reads
"Pigs Against Greed," the Cookie Monster sporting a "No Justice, No Cookie" placard.
For the NIC, logos are both targets and props. Which is why, when Kernaghan speaks to a crowd at college campuses, labour rallies or international conferences — he is never without his signature
shopping bag brimming with Disney clothes, Kathie Lee Gifford pants and other logo gear. During
his presentations, he holds up the pay slips and price tags to illustrate the vast discrepancies
between what workers are paid to make the items and what we pay to buy them. He also takes his
shopping bag with him when he visits the export processing zones in Haiti and El Salvador, pulling
out items from his bag of tricks to show workers the actual price tags of the goods they sew. In a
letter to Michael Eisner, he describes a typical reaction:
Prior to leaving for Haiti, I went to a Wal-Mart store on Long Island and purchased several
Disney garments which had been made in Haiti. I showed these to the crowd of workers, who
immediately recognized the clothing they had made... I held up a size four Pocahontas T-shirt. I
showed them the Wal-Mart price tag indicating $10.97. But it was only when I translated the
$10.97 into the local currency- 172.26 gourdes - that, all at once, in unison, the workers screamed
with shock, disbelief, anger, and a mixture of pain and sadness, as their eyes remained fixed on the
Pocahontas shirt.... In a single day, they worked on hundreds of Disney shirts. Yet the sales price of
just one shirt in the U.S. amounted to nearly five days of their wages!11

The moment when the Haitian Disney workers cried out in disbelief was captured by one of
Kernaghan's colleagues on video and included in the NLC-produced documentary Mickey Mouse
Goes to Haiti. Since then, the documentary has been shown in hundreds of schools and community
centres in North America and Europe, and many young activists say that scene played a critical role
in persuading them to join the global struggle against sweatshops.

Information about the disparity between wages and retail prices can also prove radicalizing to the
workers in the factories who, as I learned in Cavite, know little about the value of the goods they
produce. At the All Asia factory in the Cavite Export Processing Zone, for instance, the boss used
to leave the price tags for the Sassoon skirts in plain view-$52, they said. "Those price tags were
put beside the buttons, and we were able to see the prices when we passed through the packing
section," one seamstress told me. "So we computed the amount in pesos and the workers were
saying, 'So the company is having this kind of sales? Then why are we getting this small pay?'"
After management got wind of these covert discussions there were no more price tags left lying
around at All Asia.
In fact, I discovered that even finding out which brand names are being produced behind the locked
gates of the Cavite zone requires a fair bit of detective work, work that has been embraced by the
Workers' Assistance Centre outside the zone. One of the centre’s walls is covered by a bulletin
board that looks remarkably like Lora Jo Foo's logo quilt. Clothing labels are pinned all over the
board: Liz Claiborne, Eddie Bauer, Izod, Guess, Gap, Ellen Tracy, Sassoon, Old Navy. Beside each
label on the board is the name of the factory it came from: V.T. Fashion, All Asia, Du Young. The
organizers at WAC believe that this information connecting brands to work is crucial in their
attempt to empower zone workers to stand up for their legal rights, particularly since the factory
bosses are forever crying poor. When workers learn, for instance, that the Old Navy jeans they are
sewing for pennies apiece are sold by a famous company called the Gap and will sell for $50 in
America, they are more likely to demand overtime pay, or even long-promised health coverage.
Many workers are eager for this information too, which is why they have taken the great risk of
smuggling these clothing tags out of their factories; they slip them into their pockets at work, hope
that the guards don't find the scraps when they get searched at the gate, and then bring them over to
the centre. The next task for WAC is to find out something about the company that owns these
names —not always easy since many of the brands aren't even available for sale in the Philippines,
and those that are can only be found in the high-priced malls of Manila's tourist district.
In the last few years, however, gathering this information has become a little easier, in part as a
result of a marked increase in activist traffic around the world. With the aid of travel subsidies from
well-funded nongovernmental organizations and unions, representatives from the tiny Workers'
Assistance Centre in Rosario have gone to conferences all over Asia as well as in Germany and
Belgium. And only two months after I first met her in Cavite, I saw WAC organizer Cecille Tuico
again in Vancouver at the November 1997 People's Summit on APEC. The conference was
attended by several thousand activists from forty countries and was timed to coincide with a
meeting of the leaders of the eighteen Asia-Pacific economies — from Bill Clinton to Jiang Zemin
— who were gathering in Vancouver that week.

On the last day of the summit, Cecille and I skipped out of the seminars and spent an afternoon on
busy Robson Street, popping in and out of chain stores that sell many of the brand names produced
in the Cavite zone. We scoured the racks of fleece Baby Gap sleepers and booties, Banana Republic
jackets, Liz Claiborne blouses and Izod Lacoste shirts, and when we came across a "Made in the
Philippines" tag, we scribbled down the style numbers and prices. When she returned to Cavite,
Cecille converted the prices into pesos (taking into account her country's plummeting currency rate)
and carefully pinned them next to the labels on the bulletin board in the WAC office. She and her
colleagues point to these figures when workers drop by the centre distressed about an illegal firing,
back wages owed or an endless string of overnight shifts. Together, they calculate how many weeks
a zone seamstress would have to work to be able to afford one Baby Gap sleeper for her child, and
workers whisper this shocking figure to each other when they return to their cramped dormitory
rooms, or break for lunch at their sweltering factories. The news spreads through the zone like
wildfire.
I remembered our "sweatshopping" trip (as The Nation writer Eyal Press calls these odd
excursions) when I received an E-mail from Cecille some months later telling me that WAC has
finally succeeded in unionizing two garment factories inside the zone. The logos on the labels?
Gap, Arizona Jeans, Izod, J.C. Penney and Liz Claiborne.

Ever since the politics of representation first captured the imagination of feminists in the early
seventies, there have been women urging their movement sisters to look beyond how the fashion
and beauty industries oppress Westerners as consumers, and to consider the plight of the women
around the world who sweated to keep them in style. During the twenties and thirties, Emma
Goldman and the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union rallied the women's movement
behind sweatshop workers, but in recent decades, these connections have seemed somewhat out of
step with the times. Though there has always been a component of second-wave feminism that
sought to forge political connections with women in developing countries, the struggle for
internationalism never quite took hold of the movement in the way that pay equity, media
representation or abortion rights did. Somehow, the seventies rallying cry that "the personal is
political" seemed more related to the issue of how fashion made women feel about themselves than
to the global mechanisms of how the garment industry made other women work.
In 1983, the American academic Cynthia Enloe was one of the voices in the wilderness. She
insisted that the "Made in Hong Kong" and "Made in Indonesia" labels that were appearing with
greater frequency inside her clothing provided a non-abstract starting point for women who wanted
to understand the complexities of global economics. "We can become more able to talk about, and
to make sense of such alleged 'abstractions' as 'international capital' and the 'international sexual
division of labour.' Both of these concepts, so long the presumed intellectual preserve of male
theoreticians (most of whom never ask who weaves and who sews) are in reality only as 'abstract'
as the jeans in our closets and the underwear in our dresser drawers," she wrote.
At the time, thanks to a combination of too little awareness, cultural barriers and First World
parochialism, few were ready to listen. But many are listening today. Once again, this shift may be
an unexpected by-product of branding ubiquity. Now that the corporations have spun their own
global rainbow of logos and labels, the infrastructure for genuine international solidarity is there for

everyone to see and use. The logo network may have been designed to maximize consumption and
minimize production costs, but regular people can now turn themselves into "spiders" (as the
members of the Free Burma Coalition call themselves) and travel across its web as easily as the
corporations that spun it. Which is where Lora Jo Foo's logo map comes in — and Cecille Tuico's
bulletin board and Charles Kernaghan's shopping bag and Lorraine Dusky's sneaker epiphany. It's
like the Internet in general: it may have been built by the Pentagon, but it quickly became the
playground of activists and hackers.
So while cultural homogenization — the idea of everyone eating at Burger King, wearing Nike
shoes and watching Backstreet Boys videos-may inspire global claustrophobia, it has also provided
a basis for meaningful global communication. Thanks to the branded web, McDonald's workers
around the world are able to swap stories on the Internet about working under the arches; club kids
in London, Berlin and Tel Aviv can commiserate about the corporate co-optation of the rave scene;
and North American journalists can talk with poor rural factory workers in Indonesia about how
much Michael Jordan gets paid to do Nike commercials. This logo web has the unprecedented
power to connect students who face ad bombardment in their university washrooms with sweatshop
workers who make the goods in the ads and frustrated McWorkers who sell them. They may not all
speak the same language, but they now have enough common ground to begin a discussion. Playing
on the Benetton slogan, one Reclaim the Streets organizer described these new global networks as
the "United Colours of Resistance."
A world united by Benetton slogans, Nike sweatshops and McDonald's jobs might not be anyone's
Utopian global village, but its fibre-optic cables and shared cultural references are nonetheless
laying the foundations for the first truly international people's movement. That may mean fighting
Wal-Mart when it comes to town, but it also means using the Net to network with the other fiftyodd communities in North America that have fought the same battle; it means bringing resolutions
about global labour offences to the local city council meeting, and joining the international fight
against the Multilateral Agreement on Investment. It also means making sure that the cries from a
toy factory fire in Bangkok can be heard loud and clear outside the Toys 'R' Us at the mall.

As global brand-based connections gain popularity, that trail from the mall to the sweatshop
becomes better travelled. I certainly wasn't the first foreign journalist to pick through the laundry of
the Cavite Export Processing Zone. In the few months before I arrived, there had been, among
others, a German television crew and a couple of Italian documentary filmmakers who hoped to dig
up some scandal on their home-grown brand, Benetton. In Indonesia, so many journalists have
wanted to visit Nike's infamous factories that by the time I arrived in Jakarta in August 1997 the
staff at the labour-rights group Yakoma were starting to feel like professional tour guides. Every
week another journalist — or "human-rights tourist," as Gary Trudeau calls them in his cartoons —
descended upon the area. The situation was the same at a factory I tried to visit outside Medan,
where child labourers were stitching Barbie's itsy-bitsy party outfits. I met with local activists at the
Indonesian Institute for Children's Advocacy and they pulled out a photo album filled with pictures
of the NBC crew that had been there. "It won awards," program director Muhammad Joni proudly
informs me of the Dateline documentary. "They dressed up as importers. Hidden cameras-very
professional." Joni glances down at my little tape recorder and at the batik sundress I bought the
week before on the beach, unimpressed.

After four years of research, what I find most shocking is that so many supposed "dirty little
secrets" are crammed into the global broom closet with such a casual attitude. In the EPZs, labour
violations are a dime a dozen — they come tumbling out as soon as you open the door even a crack.
As The Wall Street Journal's Bob Ortega writes, "in truth, the entire apparel industry was one
continuing and underreported scandal."
With such corporate carelessness at play, no public-relations budget has proved rich enough to
clearly dissociate the brand from the factory. And the wider the disparity between the image and the
reality, the harder the company seems to get hit. Family-oriented brands like Disney, Wal-Mart and
Kathie Lee Gifford have been forced to confront the conditions under which real families produced
their wares. And when the McLibel crew released many of their most gruesome titbits about
McDonald's-tortured chickens, and hamburgers infested with E. coli bacteria, they displayed these
facts over an image of the manic plastic face of Ronald McDonald. The logo adopted by the
McLibel defendants was a cigar-chomping fat cat hiding behind a clown mask because, as the
McLibelers put it, "Children love a secret, and Ronald's is especially disgusting."
When the brand being targeted is anchored by a well-known personality, as is increasingly the case
in the era of the superbrand, these collisions between image and reality are potentially even more
explosive. For instance, when Kathie Lee Gifford was exposed for using sweatshops, she didn't
have the option of reacting like a corporate CEO — whom we expect to be motivated exclusively
by shareholder returns. The bubbly talk-show host is the human Aspartame of daytime TV. She
could hardly start talking like a callous capitalist cowboy when fifteen-year-old Wendy Diaz
publicly pleaded, "If I could talk to Kathie Lee I would ask her to help us, to end all the
maltreatment, so that they would stop yelling at us and hitting us, and so they would let us go to
night school and let us organize to protect our rights." After all, five minutes before, Gifford might
have been confessing to the free world that a child's illness had moved her to such copious tears that
she was forced to reduce the swelling under her eyes with Preparation H. She is, as Andrew Ross
writes, "a perfect foil for revelations about child labour." Confronted with Diaz's words, Gifford
had two options: throw away her entire multimillion-dollar TV-Mom persona, or become the fairy
godmother of the maquiladoras. The choice was simple enough. "It took Gifford only two weeks to
ascend to the saintly rank of labour crusader," Ross recounts.
In an odd twist of marketing fate, corporate sponsorship itself has become an important lever for
activists. And why shouldn't it? When the International Olympic Committee (10C) became mired in
bribery and doping scandals in late 1998, the media immediately focused on how the controversy
would affect the games' corporate sponsors — companies that claimed to be aghast at the IOC's
innocence lost. "It goes to the heart of why we're involved in the Olympics. Anything that affects
the positive image of the Olympics affects us," said a spokesperson for Coca-Cola.
But surely that theory cuts both ways: if sponsors can be tarnished by corruption in the events they
sponsor, those events can also be tarnished by the dubious activities of their sponsors. This is a
connection that is being made with increasing frequency as the sponsorship industry balloons. In
August 1998, Celine Dion's concert tour was picketed by human-rights activists in Boston,
Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. Although she was unaware of it, her tour sponsor — Ericsson
cellular —was among Burma's most intransigent foreign investors, refusing to cease its dealings
with the junta despite the campaign for an international boycott. But when the brand bashing

moved beyond Ericsson proper and began to spill onto Dion's diva image, it took only a week of
protests to induce Ericsson to announce its immediate withdrawal from Burma. Meanwhile,
sponsors that fail to shield performers from Anticorporate campaigns being waged against them
have also found themselves under attack from all sides. For instance, at Suzuki's Rock 'n' Roll
Marathon in San Diego, California, in May 1999, the bands mutinied against their corporate
sponsor. Hootie and the Blowfish — hardly known for their radical political views — decided to
join forces with the campaigners who were targeting the event because of Suzuki's business
dealings with the Burmese junta. Band members insisted that a Suzuki banner be taken down before
they got on stage and then performed wearing "Suzuki out of Burma" T-shirts and stickers.
In addition to aggressive sponsorship, another marketing trend that has begun to backfire is the
commercial co-optation of identity politics, discussed in Chapter 5. Rather than softening its image,
Mike's feminist-themed ads and antiracist slogans have only served to enrage women's groups and
civil-rights leaders, who insist that a company that got rich off the backs of young women in the
Third World has no business using the ideals of feminism and racial equality to sell more shoes. "I
think people feel uneasy about the repackaging of social justice images as commercials from the
start," U.S. media critic Makani Themba explains, "but they're not sure why. Then you hear these
charges and you're ready to pounce on Nike as hypocritical."
Which might explain why the first company to feel the heat of the sweatshop police was one that
had seemed to be a paragon of ethical corporatism, Levi Strauss. In 1992 Levi's became the first
company to adopt a corporate code of conduct after some of its contractors overseas were found to
be treating their workers as indentured slaves. This was not the image the company had presented
back home, with its commitment to non-hierarchical collective decision making and, later, its highprofile sponsorship of such girl-power events as the Lilith Fair festival. Similarly, the Body Shop
— though it may well be the most progressive multinational on the planet — still has a tendency to
display its good deeds in its store windows before getting its corporate house in order. Anita
Roddick's company has been the subject of numerous damning investigations in the press, which
have challenged the company's use of chemicals, its stand on unions and even its claim that its
products have not been tested on animals.
We have heard the same refrain over and over again from Nike, Reebok, the Body Shop, Starbucks,
Levi's and the Gap: "Why are you picking on us? We're the good ones!" The answer is simple.
They are singled out because the politics they have associated themselves with, which have made
them rich — feminism, ecology, inner-city empowerment —were not just random pieces of
effective ad copy that their brand managers found lying around. They are complex, essential social
ideas, for which many people have spent lifetimes fighting. That's what lends righteousness to the
rage of activists campaigning against what they see as cynical distortions of those ideas. Al Dunlap,
the notorious job-slasher-for-hire who built his reputation on ruthless layoffs, may be able to
respond to calls for corporate accountability with a rev of his chainsaw, but companies such as
Levi's and the Body Shop can't shrug them off, because they publicly presented social
accountability as the foundation of their corporate philosophy from the first. Over and over again, it
is when the advertising teams creatively overreach themselves that —like Icarus — they fall.

By some accident of fate, on February 25, 1997, the multiple layers of anti-corporate rage
converged over the Mighty Ducks hockey arena in Anaheim, California. It was Disney's annual
meeting and about 10,000 shareholders crowded into the arena to rake Michael Eisner over the
coals. They were upset that he had paid more than $100 million in a severance package to
Hollywood superagent Michael Ovitz, who'd lasted only fourteen scandal-racked months at Disney
as second in command. Eisner was further attacked for his own $400 million multiyear pay
package, as well as for stacking the board with friends and paid Disney consultants. As if
shareholders weren't angry enough, the obscene amounts of money lavished on Ovitz and Eisner
were thrown into harsh relief by an unrelated shareholders' resolution chiding Disney for paying
starvation wages to workers in its overseas factories, and calling for independent monitoring of
these practices. Outside the arena, dozens of National Labour Committee supporters were shouting
and waving placards about the plight of Disney's Haitian workforce. Of course the monitoring
resolution was trounced, but the way the issues of sweatshop labour and executive compensation
played off one another must have been music to Charles Kernaghan's ears.
Eisner, who apparently expected the gathering to be little more than a pep rally, was clearly caught
off guard by this confluence of events. Wasn't he simply playing by the rules — making his
shareholders rich and himself richer? Weren't profits up a healthy 16 percent from the year before?
Wasn't the entertainment industry, as Eisner himself reminded the restless gathering, "extremely
competitive"? Ever the expert at speaking to children, Eisner ventured, "I don't think people
understand executive compensation."
Or maybe they understood it all too well. As one shareholder commented — to much applause
— "Nobody argues that Mr. Eisner hasn't done a fantastic job. But that's more in one year than
someone like me will get in a lifetime. It's more than the President of the United States makes —
and look what he runs!" Still, Eisner's confusion is understandable. He is by no means the only
CEO paid truly goofy amounts of money - compared to some executives, he's positively roughing
it, with an annual base salary of only $750,000 (with bonuses and stock options on top of that, of
course). And Disney certainly isn't alone in its sweatshop woes. According to the U.S. Investor
Responsibility Research Centre, there were seventy-nine anti-sweatshop shareholder resolutions on
the books for major American multi-nationals between 1996 and 1998, including Dayton Hudson,
Nike, the Gap, Land's End, J.C. Penney and Toys 'R' Us. It's clear that what was being put on trial
at that rowdy meeting in Anaheim was far more than the excesses of a single company — at issue
was the central question of global economic disparity: disparity between executive and worker,
between North and South, between consumer and producer, and even between individual
shareholders and the boss. The Mouse's family values provided a helpful glass structure at which to
lob stones, but the truth is that virtually any Fortune 500 company could have been in the hot seat
that day.

A TALE OF THREE LOGOS

Dozens of brand-based campaigns have succeeded in rattling their corporate targets, in several
cases pushing them to substantially alter their policies. But three campaigns stand out for having
reached well beyond activist circles and deep into public consciousness. The tactics they have
developed — among them the use of the courts to force transparency on corporations, and the
Internet to bypass traditional media — are revolutionizing the future of political engagement. By
now it should come as no surprise that the targets of these influential campaigns are three of the
most familiar and best-tended logos on the brandscape: the Swoosh, the Shell and the Arches.

Nike CEO Phil Knight has long been a hero of the business schools. Prestigious academic
publications such as The Harvard Business Review have lauded his pioneering marketing
techniques, his understanding of branding and his early use of outsourcing. Countless 1VIBA
candidates and other students of marketing and communications have studied the Mike formula of
"brands, not products." So when Phil Knight was invited to be a guest speaker at the Stanford
University Business School-Knight's own alma mater— in May 1997, the visit was expected to be
one in a long line of Nike love-ins. Instead, Knight was greeted by a crowd of picketing students,
and when he approached the microphone he was taunted with chants of "Hey Phil, off the stage.
Pay your workers a living wage." The Nike honeymoon had come to a grinding halt.

No story illustrates the growing distrust of the culture of corporate branding more than the
international anti-Nike movement — the most publicized and tenacious of the brand-based
campaigns. Nike's sweatshop scandals have been the subject of over 1,500 news articles and
opinion columns. Its Asian factories have been probed by cameras from nearly every major media
organization, from CBS to Disney's sports station, ESPN. On top of all that, it has been the subject
of a series of Doonesbury cartoon strips and the butt of Michael Moore's documentary The Big
One. As a result, several people in Nike's PR department work full time dealing with the sweatshop
controversy—fielding complaints, meeting with local groups and developing Nike's response —
and the company has created a new executive position: vice president for corporate responsibility.
Nike has received hundreds and thousands of letters of protest, faced hundreds of both small and
large groups of demonstrators, and is the target of a dozen critical Web sites.
For the last two years, anti-Nike forces in North America and Europe have attempted to focus all
the scattered swoosh bashing on a single day. Every six months they have declared an International
Nike Day of Action, and brought their demands for fair wages and independent monitoring directly
to Nike's customers, shoppers at flagship Nike Towns in urban centres or the less glamorous Foot
Locker outlets in suburban malls. According to Campaign for Labour Rights, the largest anti-Nike
event so far took place on October 18, 1997: eighty-five cities in thirteen countries participated. Not
all the protests have attracted large crowds, but since the movement is so decentralized, the sheer
number of individual anti-Nike events has left the company's public-relations department
scrambling to get its spin onto dozens of local newscasts. Though you'd never know it from its
branding ubiquity, even Nike can't be everywhere at once.
Since so many of the stores that sell Nike products are located in malls, protests often end with a
security guard escorting participants into the parking lot. Jeff Smith, an activist from Grand Rapids,
Michigan, reported that "when we asked if private property rights ruled over free speech rights, the
[security] officer hesitated and then emphatically said YES!" (Though in the economically
depressed city of St. John's, Newfoundland, anti-Nike campaigners reported that after being thrown
out of a mall, "they were approached by a security guard who asked to sign their petition."') But
there's plenty that can be done on the sidewalk or in the mall parking lot.
SLOGANS FROM THE INTERNATIONAL ANTI-NIKE MOVEMENT:
Just Don't Do It Just Don't Nike, Do It Just Justice. Do it, Nike The Swooshtika Just Boycott It Ban the
Swoosh Nike - Fair Play? Nike, Nein, Ich Kaufe Es Nicht!
(Nike - No, I Don't Buy It!) Nike Soyez Sport! (Nike
Be a Sport)
Just Duit (It's just money)

Campaigners have dramatized Nike's labour practices through what they call "sweatshop fashion
shows," and "The Transnational Capital Auction: A Game of Survival" (the lowest bidder wins),
and a global economy treadmill (run fast, stay in the same place). In Australia, anti-Nike protestors
have been known to parade around in calico bags painted with the slogan "Rather wear a bag than
Nike." Students at the University of Colorado in Boulder dramatized the difference between the
legal minimum wage and a living wage by holding a fundraising run in which "participants pay an
entrance fee of $1.60 (daily wages for a Nike worker in Vietnam) and the winner will receive $2.10
(the price of three square meals in Vietnam)." Meanwhile, activists in Austin, Texas, made a giant

papier-mâché Nike sneaker piñata, and a protest outside a Regina, Saskatchewan, shopping centre
featured a deface-the-swoosh booth. The last stunt is something of a running theme in all the antiNike actions: Nike's logo and slogan have been jammed so many times — on T-shirts, stickers,
placards, banners and pins — that the semiotic bruises have turned them black and blue (see list
below).
Tellingly, the anti-Nike movement is at its strongest inside the company's home state of Oregon,
even though the area has reaped substantial economic benefits from Nike's success (Nike is the
largest employer in Portland and a significant local philanthropist). Phil Knight's neighbours,
nonetheless, have not all rushed to his defence in his hour of need. In fact, since the Life magazine
soccer-ball story broke, many Oregonians have been out for blood. The demonstrations outside the
Portland Nike Town are among the largest and most militant in the country, sometimes sporting a
menacing giant Phil Knight puppet with dollar signs for eyes or a twelve-foot Nike swoosh dragged
by small children (to dramatize child labour). And in contravention of the principles of nonviolence that govern the anti-Nike movement, one protest in Eugene, Oregon, led to acts of
vandalism including the tearing-down of a fence surrounding the construction of a new Nike Town,
gear pulled off shelves at an existing Nike store and, according to one eyewitness, "an entire rack of
clothes...dumped off a balcony into a fountain below."
Local papers in Oregon have aggressively (sometimes gleefully) followed Knight's sweatshop
scandals, and the daily paper The Oregonian sent a reporter to Southeast Asia to do its own lengthy
investigation of the factories.
Mark Zusman, editor of the Oregon newspaper The Willamette Week, publicly admonished Knight
in a 1996 "memo": "Frankly, Phil, it's time to get a little more sophisticated about this media orgy...
Oregonians already have suffered through the shame of Tonya Harding, Bob Packwood and Wes
Cooley. Spare us the added humiliation of being known as the home of the most exploitative
capitalist in the free world."
Even Mike's charitable donations have become controversial. In the midst of a critical fundraising
drive to try to address a $15 million shortfall, the Portland School Board was torn apart by debate
about whether to accept Mike's gift of $500,000 in cash and swooshed athletic gear. The board
ended up accepting the donation, but not before looking their gift horse publicly in the mouth. "I
asked myself," school board trustee Joseph Tarn told The Oregonian, "Mike contributed this money
so my children can have a better education, but at whose expense? At the expense of children who
work for six cents an hour?... As an immigrant and as an Asian I have to face this moral and ethical
dilemma."
Mike's sponsorship scandals have reached far beyond the company's home state. In Edmonton,
Alberta, teachers, parents and some students tried to block Mike from sponsoring a children's street
hockey program because "a company which profits from child labour in Pakistan ought not to be
held up as a hero to Edmonton children." At least one school involved in the city-wide program
sent back its swooshed equipment to Mike headquarters. And when Mike approached the City of
Ottawa Council in March 1998 to suggest building one of its swooshed gymnasium floors in a local
community centre, it faced questions about "blood money." Mike withdrew its offer and gave the
court to a more grateful centre, run by the Boys and Girls Clubs. The dilemma of accepting Mike
sponsorship money has also exploded on university campuses, as we will see in the next chapter.

At first, much of the outrage stemmed from the fact that when the sweatshop scandal hit the papers,
Nike wasn't really acting all that sorry about it. While Kathie Lee Gifford and the Gap had at least
displayed contrition when they got caught with their sweatshops showing, Phil Knight had
practically stonewalled: denying responsibility, attacking journalists, blaming rogue contractors and
sending out flacks to speak for the company. While Kathie Lee was crying on TV, Michael Jordan
was shrugging his shoulders and saying that his job was to shoot hoop, not play politics. And while
the Gap agreed to allow a particularly controversial factory in El Salvador to be monitored by local
human-rights groups, Mike was paying lip service to a code of conduct that its Asian workers,
when interviewed, had never even heard of.
But there was a critical difference between Mike and the Gap at this stage. Mike didn't panic when
its scandals hit the middle-American mall, because the mall, while it is indeed where most Mike
products are sold, is not where Mike's image was made. Unlike the Gap, Mike has drawn on the
inner cities, merging, as we've seen, with the styles of poor black and Latino youth to load up on
imagery and attitude. Mike's branding power is thoroughly intertwined with the African-American
heroes who have endorsed its products since the mid-eighties: Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley,
Scottie Pippen, Michael Johnson, Spike Lee, Tiger Woods, Bo Jackson-not to mention the rappers
who wear Mike gear on stage. While hip-hop style was the major influence at the mall, Phil Knight
must have known that as long as Mike was King Brand with Jordan fans in Compton and the
Bronx, he could be stirred but not shaken. Sure, their parents, teachers and church leaders might be
tut-tut ting over sweatshops, but as far as Mike's core demographic of thirteen- to seventeen-yearold kids was concerned, the swoosh was still made of Teflon.
By 1997, it had become clear to Mike's critics that if they were serious about taking on the swoosh
in an image war, they would have to get at the source of the brand's cachet — and as Mick
Alexander of the multicultural Third Force magazine wrote in the summer of that year, they weren't
even close. "Nobody has figured out how to make Mike break down and cry. The reason is that
nobody has engaged African Americans in the fight.... To gain significant support from
communities of colour, corporate campaigns need to make connections between Mike's overseas
operations and conditions here at home."
The connections were there to be made. It is the crudest irony of Mike's "brands, not products"
formula that the people who have done the most to infuse the swoosh with cutting-edge meaning
are the very people most hurt by the company's pumped-up prices and nonexistent manufacturing
base. It is inner-city youth who have most directly felt the impact of Mike's decision to manufacture
its products outside the U.S., both in high unemployment rates and in the erosion of the community
tax base (which sets the stage for the deterioration of local public schools).
Instead of jobs for their parents, what the inner-city kids get from Nike is the occasional visit from
its marketers and designers on "bro-ing" pilgrimages. "Hey, bro, what do you think of these new
Jordans - are they fresh or what?" The effect of high-priced cool hunters whipping up brand frenzy
on the cracked asphalt basketball courts of Harlem, the Bronx and Compton has already been
discussed: kids incorporate the brands into gang-wear uniforms; some want the gear so badly they
are willing to sell drugs, steal, mug, even kill for it. Jessie Collins, executive director of the
Edenwald-Gun Hill Neighbourhood Centre in the northeast Bronx, tells me that it's sometimes drug
or gang money, but more often it's the mothers' minimum-wage salaries or welfare checks that are

spent on disposable status wear. When I asked her about the media reports of kids stabbing each
other for their $150 Air Jordans she said dryly, "It's enough to beat up on your mother for... $150 is
a hell of a lot of money."
Shoe-store owners like Steven Roth of Essex House of Fashion are often uncomfortable with the
way so-called street fashions play out for real on the post-industrial streets of Newark, New Jersey,
where his store is located.
I do get weary and worn down from it all. I'm always forced to face the fact that I make my money
from poor people. A lot of them are on welfare. Sometimes a mother will come in here with a kid,
and the kid is dirty and poorly dressed. But the kid wants a hundred-twenty-buck pair of shoes and
that stupid mother buys them for him. I can feel that kid's inner need — this desire to own these
things and have the feelings that go with them — but it hurts me that this is the way things are.
It's easy to blame the parents for giving in, but that "deep inner need" for designer gear has grown
so intense that it has confounded everyone from community leaders to the police. Everyone pretty
much agrees that brands like Nike are playing a powerful surrogate role in the ghetto, subbing for
everything from self-esteem to African-American cultural history to political power. What they are
far less sure about is how to fill that need with empowerment and a sense of self-worth that does
not necessarily come with a logo attached. Even broaching the subject of brand fetishism to these
kids is risky. With so much emotion invested in celebrity consumer goods, many kids take criticism
of Nike or Tommy as a personal attack, as grave a transgression as insulting someone's mother to
his face.
Not surprisingly, Nike sees its appeal among disadvantaged kids differently. By supporting sports
programs in Boys and Girls Clubs, by paying to repave urban basketball courts and by turning highperformance sports gear into street fashions, the company claims it is sending out the inspirational
message that even poor kids can "Just Do It." In its press material and ads, there is an almost
messianic quality to Nike's portrayal of its role in the inner cities: troubled kids will have higher
self-esteem, fewer unwanted pregnancies and more ambition — all because at Nike "We see them
as athletes." For Nike, its $150 Air Jordans are not a shoe but a kind of talisman with which poor
kids can run out of the ghetto and better their lives. Nike's magic slippers will help them fly —just
as they made Michael Jordan fly.
A remarkable, subversive accomplishment? Maybe. But one can't help thinking that one of the
main reasons black urban youth can get out of the ghetto only by rapping or shooting hoops is that
Nike and the other multinationals are reinforcing stereotypical images of black youth and
simultaneously taking all the jobs away. As U.S. Congressman Bernie Sanders and
Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur stated in a letter to the company, Nike has played a pivotal part in
the industrial exodus from urban centres. "Nike has led the way in abandoning the manufacturing
workers of the United States and their families.... Apparently, Nike believes that workers in the
United States are good enough to purchase your shoe products, but are no longer worthy enough to
manufacture them."
And when the company's urban branding strategy is taken in conjunction with this employment
record, Nike ceases to be the saviour of the inner city and turns into the guy who steals your job,

then sells you a pair of overpriced sneakers and yells, "Run like hell!" Hey, it's the only way out of
the ghetto, kid. Just do it.
That's what Mike Gitelson thought, anyway. A social worker at the Bronx's Edenwald-Gun Hill
Neighbourhood Centre, he was unimpressed with the swoosh's powers as a self-help guru in the
projects and "sick of seeing kids wearing sneakers they couldn't afford and which their parents
couldn't afford."" Nike's critics on college campuses and in the labour movement may be fuelled
largely by moral outrage, but Mike Gitelson and his colleagues simply feel ripped off. So rather
than lecturing the kids on the virtues of frugality, they began telling them about how Nike made the
shoes that they wanted so badly. Gitelson told them about the workers in Indonesia who earned $2 a
day, he told them that it cost Nike only $5 to make the shoes they bought for between $100 and
$180, and he told them about how Nike didn't make any of its shoes in the U.S. - which was part of
the reason their parents had such a tough time finding work. "We got really angry," says Gitelson,
"because they were taking so much money from us here and then going to other countries and
exploiting people even worse.... We want our kids to see how it affects them here on the streets, but
also how here on the streets affects people in Southeast Asia." His colleague at the centre, youth
worker Leo Johnson, lays out the issue using the kids' own lingo. "Yo, dude," he tells his preteen
audiences, "you're being suckered if you pay $100 for a sneaker that costs $5 to make. If somebody
did that to you on the block, you know where it's going."
The kids at the centre were upset to learn about the sweatshops but they were clearly most pissed
off that Phil Knight and Michael Jordan were playing them for chumps. They sent Phil Knight a
hundred letters about how much money they had spent on Nike gear over the years — and how, the
way they figured it, Nike owed them big time. "I just bought a pair of Nikes for $100," one kid
wrote. "It's not right what you're doing. A fair price would have been $30. Could you please send
me back $70?" When the company answered the kids with a form letter, "That's when we got really
angry and started putting together the protest," Gitelson says.
They decided the protest would take the form of a "shoe-in" at the Nike Town at Fifth Avenue and
Fifty-seventh Street. Since most of the kids at the centre are full-fledged swoosh ah olics, their
closets are jam-packed with old Air Jordans and Air Carnivores that they would no longer even
consider wearing. To put the obsolete shoes to practical use, they decided to gather them together in
garbage bags and dump them on the doorstep of Nike Town.
When Nike executives got wind that a bunch of black and Latino kids from the Bronx were
planning to publicly diss their company, the form letters came to an abrupt halt. Up to that point,
Nike had met most criticism by attacking its critics as members of "fringe groups," but this was
different: if a backlash took root in the inner cities, it could sink the brand at the mall. As Gitelson
puts it, "Our kids are exactly who Nike depends upon to set the trends for them so that the rest of
the country buys their sneakers. White middle-class adults who are fighting them, well, it's almost
okay. But when youth of colour start speaking out against Nike, they start getting scared."
The executives in Oregon also knew, no doubt, that Edenwald was only the tip of the iceberg. For
the past couple of years, debates have been raging in hip-hop scenes about rappers "label whoring
for Nike and Tommy" instead of supporting black-owned clothing companies like FUBU (For Us
By Us). And rapper KRS-One planned to launch the Temple of Hip Hop, a project that promised to

wrest the culture of African-American youth away from white record and clothing labels and return
it to the communities that built it. It was against this backdrop that, on September 10, 1997 — two
weeks before the shoe-in protest was scheduled to take place — Nike's chief of public relations,
Vada Manager, made the unprecedented move of flying in from Oregon with a colleague to try to
convince the centre that the swoosh was a friend of the projects.
"He was working overtime to put the spins on us," says Gitelson. It didn't work. At the meeting, the
centre laid out three very concrete demands:
1. Those who work for Nike overseas should be paid a living wage, with independent monitoring to ensure that it is
occurring.
2. Nike sneakers should be sold less expensively here in America with no concessions to American workforce (i.e. no
downsizing, or loss of benefits)
3. Nike should seriously re-invest in the inner city in America, especially New York City since we have been the
subject of much of their advertising. Gitelson may have recognized that Nike was scared—but not that scared. Once it
became clear that the two parties were at an impasse, the meeting turned into a scolding session as the two Nike
executives were required to listen to Edenwald director Jessie Collins comparing the company's Asian sweatshops with
her experience as a young girl picking cotton in the share-cropping South. Back in Alabama, she told Manager, she
earned $2 a day, just like the Indonesians. "And maybe a lot of Americans can't identify with those workers' situation,
but I certainly can."

Vada Manager returned to Oregon defeated and the protest went off as planned, with two hundred
participants from eleven community centres around New York. The kids — most of whom were
between eleven and thirteen years old —hooted and hollered and dumped several clear garbage
bags of smelly old Nikes at the feet of a line of security guards who had been brought in on special
assignment to protect the sacred Nike premises. Vada Manager again flew to New York to run
damage control, but there was little he could do. Local TV crews covered the event, as did an ABC
news team and The New York Times,
In a harsh bit of bad timing for the company, the Times piece ran on a page facing another story
about Nike. Graphically underlining the urgency of the protest, this story reported that a fourteenyear-old boy from Crown Heights had just been murdered by a fifteen-year-old boy who beat him
and left him on the subway tracks with a train approaching. "Police Say Teenager Died for His
Sneakers and Beeper," the headline read. And the brand of his sneakers? Air Jordans. The article
quoted the killer's mother saying that her son had got mixed up with gangs because he wanted to
"have nice things." A friend of the victim explained that wearing designer clothes and carrying a
beeper had become a way for poor kids to "feel important."
The African-American and Latino kids outside Nike Town on Fifth Avenue — the ones swarmed
by cameras and surrounded by curious onlookers —were feeling pretty important, too. Taking on
Nike "toe to toe," as they said, turned out to be even more fun than wearing Nikes. With the Fox
News camera pointed in his face, one of the young activists — a thirteen-year-old boy from the
Bronx —stared into the lens and delivered a message to Phil Knight: "Nike, we made you. We can
break you."
What is perhaps most remarkable about the Nike backlash is its durability. After four solid years in
the public eye, the Nike story still has legs (so too, of course, does the Nike brand). Still, most

corporate scandals are successfully faced down with a statement of "regret" and a few glossy ads of
children playing happily under the offending logo. Not with Nike. The news reports, labour studies
and academic research documenting the sweat behind the swoosh have yet to slow down, and Nike
critics remain tireless at dissecting the steady stream of materials churned out by Nike's PR
machine. They were unmoved by Phil Knight's presence on the White House Task Force on
Sweatshops — despite his priceless photo op standing beside President Clinton at the Rose Garden
press conference. They sliced and diced the report Nike commissioned from civil-rights leader
Andrew Young, pointing out that Young completely dodged the question of whether Nike's factory
wages are inhumanely exploitative, and attacking him for relying on translators provided by Nike
itself when he visited the factories in Indonesia and Vietnam. As for Nike's other study-for-hire —
this one by a group of Dartmouth business students who concluded that workers in Vietnam were
living the good life on less than $2 a day — well, everyone pretty much ignored that one altogether.
Finally, in May 1998, Phil Knight stepped out from behind the curtain of spin doctors and called a
press conference in Washington to address his critics directly. Knight began by saying that he had
been painted as a "corporate crook, the perfect corporate villain for these times." He acknowledged
that his shoes "have become synonymous with slave wages, forced overtime and arbitrary abuse."
Then, to much fanfare, he unveiled a plan to improve working conditions in Asia. It contained some
tough new regulations on factory air quality and the use of petroleum-based chemicals. It promised
to provide classes inside some Indonesian factories and promised not to hire anyone under eighteen
years old in the shoe factories. But there was still nothing substantial in the plan about allowing
independent outside monitors to inspect the factories, and there were no wage raises for the
workers. Knight did promise, however, that Nike's contractors would no longer be permitted to
appeal to the Indonesian government for a waiver on the minimum wage.
It wasn't enough. That September the San Francisco human-rights group Global Exchange, one of
the company's harshest critics, released an alarming report on the status of Mike's Indonesian
workers in the midst of the country's economic and political crisis. "While workers producing Nike
shoes were low paid before their currency, the rupee, began plummeting in late 1997, the dollar
value of their wages has dropped from $2.47/day in 1997 to 80 cents/day in 1998." Meanwhile, the
report noted that with soaring commodity prices, workers "estimated that their cost of living had
gone up anywhere from 100 to 300 per cent." Global Exchange called on Nike to double the wages
of its Indonesian workforce, an exercise that would cost it $20 million a year — exactly what
Michael Jordan is paid annually to endorse the company.
Not surprisingly, Nike did not double the wages, but it did, three weeks later, give 30 percent of the
Indonesian workforce a 25 percent raise. That, too, failed to silence the crowds outside the
superstores, and five months later Nike came forward again, this time with what vice president of
corporate responsibility Maria Eitel called "an aggressive corporate responsibility agenda at Nike."
As of April 1, 1999, workers would get another 6 percent raise. The company had also opened up a
Vietnamese factory near Ho Chi Minh City to outside health and safety monitors, who found
conditions much improved. Dara O'Rourke of the University of California at Berkeley reported that
the factory had "implemented important changes over the past 18 months which appear to have
significantly reduced worker exposures to toxic solvents, adhesives and other chemicals." What
made the report all the more remarkable was that O'Rourke's inspection was a genuinely
independent one: in fact, less than two years earlier, he had enraged the company by leaking a

report conducted by Ernst & Young that showed that Nike was ignoring widespread violations at
that same factory.
O'Rourke's findings weren't all glowing. There were still persistent problems with air quality,
factory overheating and safety gear —and he had visited only the one factory. As well, Nike's
much-heralded 6 percent pay raise for Indonesian workers still left much to be desired; it amounted
to an increase of one cent an hour and, with inflation and currency fluctuation, only brought wages
to about half of what Nike pay checks were worth before the economic crisis. Even so, these were
significant gestures coming from a company that two years earlier was playing the role of the
powerless global shopper, claiming that contractors alone had the authority to set wages and make
the rules.
The resilience of the Nike campaign in the face of the public-relations onslaught is persuasive
evidence that invasive marketing, coupled with worker abandonment, strikes a wide range of people
from different walks of life as grossly unfair and unsustainable. Moreover, many of those people
are not interested in letting Nike off the hook simply because this formula has become the standard
one for capitalism-as-usual. On the contrary, there seems to be a part of the public psyche that likes
kicking the most macho and extreme of all the sporting-goods companies in the shins — I mean
really likes it. Nike's critics have shown that they don't want this story to be brushed under the rug
with a reassuring bit of corporate PR; they want it out in the open, where they can keep a close eye
on it.
In large part, this is because Nike's critics know that the company's sweatshop scandals are not the
result of a series of freak accidents: they know that the criticisms levelled at Nike apply to all the
brand-based shoe companies contracting out to a global maze of firms. But rather than this serving
as a justification, Nike —as the market leader-has become a lightning rod for this broader
resentment. It has been latched on to as the essential story of the extremes of the current global
economy: the disparities between those who profit from Nike's success and those who are exploited
by it are so gaping that a child could understand what is wrong with this picture and indeed (as we
will see in the next chapter) it is children and teenagers who most readily do.
So, when does the total boycott of Nike products begin? Not soon, apparently. A cursory glance
around any city in the world shows that the swoosh is still ubiquitous; some athletes still tattoo it on
their navels, and plenty of high-school students still deck themselves out in the coveted gear. But at
the same time, there can be little doubt that the millions of dollars that Nike has saved in labour
costs over the years are beginning to bite back, and take a toll on its bottom line. "We didn't think
that the Nike situation would be as bad as it seems to be," said Nikko stock analyst Tim Finucane in
The Wall Street Journal in March 1998. Wall Street really had no choice but to turn on the
company that had been its darling for so many years. Despite the fact that Asia's plummeting
currencies meant that Mike's labour costs in Indonesia, for instance, were a quarter of what they
were before the crash, the company was still suffering. Mike's profits were down, orders were
down, stock prices were way down, and after an average annual growth of 34 percent since 1995,
quarterly earnings were suddenly down 70 percent. By the third quarter, which ended in February
1999, Mike's profits were once again up 70 percent—but by the company's own account, the
recovery was not the result of rebounding sales but rather of Mike's decision to cut jobs and
contracts. In fact, Mike's revenues and future orders were down in 1999 for the second year in a
row.

Mike has blamed its financial problems on everything but the human-rights campaign. The Asian
currency crisis was the reason Mikes weren't selling well in Japan and South Korea; or it was
because Americans were buying "brown shoes" (walking shoes and hiking boots) as opposed to big
white sneakers. But the brown-shoe excuse rang hollow. Mike makes plenty of brown shoes — it
has a line of hiking boots, and it owns Cole Haan (and recently saved millions by closing down the
Cole Haan factory in Portland, Maine, and moving production to Mexico and Brazil). More to the
point, Adidas staged a massive comeback during the very year that Mike was free-falling. In the
quarter when Mike nose-dived, Adidas sales were up 42 percent, its net income was up 48 percent,
to $255 million, and its stock price had tripled in two years. The German company, as we have
seen, turned its fortunes around by copying Mike's production structure and all but Xeroxing its
approach to marketing and sponsorships (the political implications of that will be dealt with in
Chapter 18). In 1997-98, Adidas even redesigned its basketball shoes so they looked just like
Mikes: big, white and ultra high tech. But unlike Mikes, they sold briskly. So much for the brownshoe theory.
Over the years Mike has tried dozens of tactics to silence the cries of its critics, but the most ironic
by far has been the company's desperate attempt to hide behind its product. "We're not political
activists. We are a footwear manufacturer," said Nike spokeswoman Donna Gibbs, when the
sweatshop scandal first began to erupt. A footwear manufacturer? This from the company that made
a concerted decision in the mid-eighties not to be about boring corporeal stuff like footwear — and
certainly nothing as crass as manufacturing. Nike wanted to be about sports, Knight told us, it
wanted to be about the idea of sports, then the idea of transcendence through sports; then it wanted
to be about self-empowerment, women's rights, racial equality. It wanted its stores to be temples, its
ads a religion, its customers a nation, its workers a tribe. After taking us all on such a branded ride,
to turn around and say "Don't look at us, we just make shoes" rings laughably hollow.
Mike was the most inflated of all the balloon brands, and the bigger it grew, the louder it popped.

In North America, Nike has been at the forefront of the burgeoning political movement taking aim
at the power of multinationals, but in Britain, Germany and the Netherlands, that dubious honour
has belonged to Royal Dutch/Shell.
It began in February 1995 when Shell finalized its plans to dispose of a rusted and obsolete oilstorage platform, known as Brent Spar, by sinking it in the Atlantic Ocean, 150 miles off the coast
of Scotland. The environmental group Greenpeace was against the plan, claiming the 14,500-ton rig
should be towed to land, where the oil sludge could be contained and the rig's parts recycled. Shell
countered that land disposal was unsafe, not to mention impossible. Then, on April 30, just as Shell
began towing the platform to its watery grave, a group of Greenpeace activists showed up in a
helicopter and tried to land on the Brent Spar. Shell fended off the aircraft with water cannons, but
the entire episode was captured on videotape, and the images were sent via satellite to TV stations
around the world.

It was vintage Greenpeace, ever the made-for-TV activists. But the impact those images from the
Brent Spar had on the European public took even Greenpeace by surprise. Before the Brent Spar
incident, the group was teetering on the brink of obsolescence — the eco movement had been under
attack, and appeared to be sputtering out in the wake of recession, and Greenpeace itself had lost
credibility because of internal divisions and questionable financial and tactical policies. When
Greenpeace decided to launch a campaign against the sinking of the Brent Spar, it had no idea that
this rather arcane issue would become a cause celebre. As Robin Grove-White, chairman of
Greenpeace U.K., readily admits, "No one, and certainly not people within Greenpeace, anticipated
the profound and continuing reverberations."
Unlike the environmentally disastrous Exxon Valdez oil spill four years earlier (a clear-cut case of
negligence involving a drunken captain), it wasn't as if Shell was doing anything illegal. The plan
had received full approval from John Major's governing Conservatives, and sinking had become a
standard way of disposing of old platforms. Besides, it was even debatable whether Greenpeace's
land-disposal alternative was more ecologically sound than Shell's proposed deep-sea dunk. But the
image that Greenpeace generated -of an ugly, giant, rusted pollution generator fending off the good
green activists that were buzzing it like dogged mosquitoes — caught people's attention, and gave
them a timely and rare opportunity to stop and think about what was being proposed. And much of
the public decided that Shell wanted to sink its hunk of metal and sludge because the most
profitable corporation in the world was too cheap to come up with a better plan to dispose of its
garbage. This view was reinforced by a damning study that found that land disposal of the Brent
Spar would cost Shell US$70 million, while sinking it would cost a mere US$16 million. Coming
from a $128 billion company, this apparent penny-pinching did not impress the gasoline-buying
public at all.
That Shell's actions were legal and Greenpeace's were not seemed to be entirely beside the point. In
the eyes of many Europeans, Shell was morally wrong. Thousands of people protested outside its
gas stations, and in Germany the Shell office reported a sales drop of between 20 and 50 percent
after the scandal began - "the worst we have experienced," said the oil multinational's German head,
Peter Duncan. A firebomb exploded at a Shell station in Hamburg ("Don't sink the Brent Spar Oil
Platform" was the message left behind), and there was a drive-by shooting at a Frankfurt outlet.
{No one was injured.) The unofficial boycott also spread through Britain to Denmark, Austria and
the Netherlands.
Four months after the protests began, on June 20, 1995, something unprecedented happened: Shell
backed down. It would spend the extra millions to tow the platform to Norway, where it would be
dismantled on land. According to The Wall Street Journal, it was "a humiliating and painful Uturn." Grove-White articulates the extent of the Brent Spar victory: "For the first time, an
environmental group had catalyzed international opinion to bring about the kind of change of policy
that unsettled the very basis of executive authority. However briefly, the world turned upside downthe rule book had been rewritten."
Before the Brent Spar campaign was launched, there had been internal battles within Greenpeace
about whether the group could "sell" the disposal of an old industrial hunk of junk as a galvanizing,
media-friendly issue. Dutch Greenpeace campaigner Giys Thieme recalls the concerns inside the

organization: "It wasn't an oil campaign, it wasn't an atmosphere campaign, it wasn't a chlorine
campaign." Neither was it a fight for fish, or whales, or even cute baby seals. Brent Spar, it turns
out, was about the idea of preserving untouched space, just as the anti-logging protests in British
Columbia's Clayoquot Sound a year earlier had been about protecting one of the last remaining
stands of ancient, virgin forest. Clayoquot was about biodiversity, but it was also about preserving
the idea of wilderness, and Brent Spar was much the same. Although Greenpeace presented
scientific studies on the ecological impact the oil platform would have on the ocean floor (getting
some of its facts wrong along the way), the fight was not so much about environmental protection
in the traditional sense as it was about the need to keep the Atlantic Ocean floor from being used as
a junkyard. Shell's plans to bury the monstrosity in the depths of the sea resonated in the public
psyche worldwide: here was proof that if multinationals were left to their own devices, there would
be no open space left on earth — even the depths of the ocean, the last great wilderness, would be
colonized.
Shell, the British government and much of the business press pointed out that this reaction was
entirely irrational. "Science Loses to Joe Six-Pack" a headline in The Wall Street Journal
announced, while The Economist declared "A Defeat for Rational Decision Making." They were
right, in a way. This concept of protecting the unknowable — for no empirical reason in the short
term except that it comforts us that it is there —was indeed amorphous, but it was also powerful.
As Guardian columnist Suzanne Moore wrote, Brent Spar had at least as much to do with
mysticism as with science: "In the depths strange species lurk, and though we may never ever see
them, we feel in our hearts that they should be left alone. Why must they share the great dark deep
with bits and bobs from a dismembered oil platform?"
The lesson Greenpeace took away from its Brent Spar victory, writes Grove-White, was about the
sanctity of "the global commons" — places not named on any map, not owned by any private
interest and thus belonging to everybody. The group also learned another lesson, something the
anti-Mike campaigners had also discovered: targeting a big, rich, ubiquitous multinational
corporation is to the late nineties what saving the whales was to the late eighties. It is populist and it
is popular, and it was enough to bring Green-peace back from the brink of death. After Brent Spar,
the group was showered with members and money and, as The Guardian reported, it was even
bequeathed estates. "One woman had phoned to say she had changed her will. 'LefLall estate to
Greenpeace,' says the note. Wants us to 'buy an inflatable with it and bash Shell.'" In its Brent Spar
post-mortem The Wall Street Journal noted gravely that in the current climate, "economic warfare
may be the best way to wage eco-warfare."
Shell's capitulation also provided activists with another lesson. After going to the wall defending
the appropriateness and inescapability of Shell's original plan, Prime Minister John Major was left
looking like a corporate lap dog — and an unloved one at that. When Shell reversed its position,
Major could only mutter that the executives were "wimps" for caving in to public pressure. His
position was so compromised that it may well have played a role in his decision, only two days
after Shell's U-turn, to step down as head of the Conservative Party and force a vote on his
leadership. In this way, Brent Spar proved that corporations — even a notoriously cagey and
cloistered company like Royal Dutch/Shell — are sometimes as vulnerable to public pressure as
democratically elected governments (occasionally more so).

The lesson proved particularly relevant in the next Shell challenge — the need to focus world
attention on the multinational's role in the despoliation of Nigeria, under the protection of the
corrupt government of the late General Sani Abacha. If the general wasn't vulnerable to pressure,
Shell certainly was.

Since the 1950s, Shell Nigeria has extracted $30 billion worth of oil from the land of the Ogoni
people, in the Niger Delta. Oil revenue makes up 80 percent of the Nigerian economy —$10 billion
annually —and, of that, more than half comes from Shell. But not only have the Ogoni people been
deprived of the profits from their rich natural resource, many still live without running water or
electricity, and their land and water have been poisoned by open pipelines, oil spills and gas fires.
Under the leadership of the writer and Nobel Peace Prize nominee Ken Saro-Wiwa, the Movement
for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) campaigned for reform, and demanded
compensation from Shell. In response, and in order to keep the oil profits flowing into the
government's coffers, General Sani Abacha directed the Nigerian military to take aim at the Ogoni.
They killed and tortured thousands. The Ogoni not only blamed Abacha for the attacks, they also
accused Shell of treating the Nigerian military as a private police force, paying it to quash peaceful
protest on Ogoni land, in addition to giving financial support and legitimacy to the Abacha regime.
Facing mounting protests within Nigeria, Shell withdrew from Ogoni land in 1993 — a move that
only put further pressure on the military to remove the Ogoni threat. A leaked memo from the head
of the Rivers State Internal Security Force of the Nigerian Army was quite explicit: "Shell
operations still impossible unless ruthless military operations are undertaken for smooth economic
activities to commence.... Recommendations: Wasting operations during MOSOP and other
gatherings making constant military presence justifiable. Wasting targets cutting across
communities and leadership cadres especially vocal individuals of various groups."
On May 10, 1994 —five days after the memo was written —Ken Saro-Wiwa said, "This is it. They
[the Nigerian military] are going to arrest us all and execute us. All for Shell." Twelve days later, he
was arrested and tried for murder. Before receiving his sentence, Saro-Wiwa told the tribunal, "I
and my colleagues are not the only ones on trial. Shell is here on trial.... The company has, indeed,
ducked this particular trial, but its day will surely come." Then, on November 10, 1995 —despite
pressure from the international community, including the Canadian and Australian governments,
and to a lesser extent the governments of Germany and France — the Nigerian military government
executed Saro-Wiwa along with eight other Ogoni leaders who had protested against Shell. It
became an international incident and, once again, people took their protests to their Shell stations,
widely boycotting the company. In San Francisco Greenpeaceniks staged a re-enactment of SaroWiwa's murder, with the noose fastened around the towering Shell sign.
As Reclaim the Streets' John Jordan said of multinationals: "Inadvertently, they have helped us see
the whole problem as one system." And here was that interconnected system in action: Shell, intent
on sinking a monstrous oil platform off the coast of Britain, was simultaneously entangled in a
human-rights debacle in Nigeria, in the same year that it laid off workers (despite earning huge
profits), all so that it could pump gas into the cars of London — the very issue that had launched
Reclaim the Streets. Because Ken Saro-Wiwa was a poet and playwright, his case was also claimed

by the international freedom-of-expression group, PEN. Writers, including the English playwright
Harold Pinter and the Nobel Prize-winning novelist Nadine Gordimer, took up the cause of SaroWiwa's right to express his views against Shell, and turned his persecution into the highest-profile
free-expression case since the government of Iran declared a fatwa against Salman Rushdie,
offering a bounty on his head. In an article for The New York Times, Gordimer wrote that "to buy
Nigeria's oil under the conditions that prevail is to buy oil in exchange for blood. Other people's
blood; the exaction of the death penalty on Nigerians."
The convergence of social-justice, labour and environmental issues in the two Shell campaigns was
not a fluke — it goes to the very heart of the emerging spirit of global activism. Ken Saro-Wiwa
was killed for fighting to protect his environment, but an environment that encompassed more than
the physical landscape that was being ravaged and despoiled by Shell's invasion of the delta. Shell's
mistreatment of Ogoni land is both an environmental and a social issue, because natural-resource
companies are notorious for lowering their standards when they drill and mine in the Third World.
Shell's opponents readily draw parallels between the company's actions in Nigeria, its history of
collaborating with the former apartheid government in South Africa, its ongoing presence in the
Timor Gap in Indonesian-occupied East Timor and its violent clashes with the Nahua people in the
Peruvian Amazon - as well as its standoff with the U'wa people of the Colombian Andes, who
threatened in January 1997 to commit mass suicide if Shell went ahead with its drilling plans.
In Saro-Wiwa, civil liberties came together with antiracism; anticapitalism with environmentalism;
ecology with labour rights. The bright yellow bulbous logo of Shell —Saro-Wiwa's Goliath of an
opponent —became a common enemy for all concerned citizens, to the extent that their
governments around the world were required to put the matter on the international agenda. PEN
protested against Shell, as did the campaign department at the Body Shop, the activist shareholders
who placed the Ogoni plight on the agenda of three consecutive Shell annual meetings and
thousands upon thousands of others. In June 1998, Owens Wiwa, Ken's brother, wrote this of the
company's situation:
For centuries, corporations have declared huge profits from evil practices like the trans-Atlantic
slave trade, colonialism, Apartheid and [from] dictatorships whose actions are genocidal. They
have often gotten away with their loot, leaving governments to apologize. In this case, at the
twilight of the 20th century, Shell has been caught in the triangle of ecosystem destruction, human
rights abuse and health impairment of the Ogoni people. An apology will not be enough. We
anticipate a clean-up of our soil, water and air; adequate, fair and equitable compensation for (a)
the environmental damages, (b) human rights abuses due directly and indirectly to Shell activities
and (c) the negative health impacts their services have on the people.
To hear Shell tell it, these reparations are already well under way. "Shell continues to invest in
community and environmental projects in Nigeria," R.B. Blakely, a spokesperson for Shell Canada,
informed me. "Last year, Shell spent $20 million establishing hospitals, schools, educational
programs and scholarships" (MOSOP put the figure at closer to $9 million, and says only a fraction
of this amount was spent on Ogoni land). The company has also, according to Blakely, revised its
"statement of business principles. These principles, which include the company's environmental
performance as well as its responsibilities to the communities where we operate, apply to all
companies in the Shell Group in all parts of the world."

To arrive at these principles, Shell has looked deep into its corporate psyche and has focus grouped
and deconstructed itself into a pulp. It has put its employees through a kind of New Ageconsultancy boot camp, resulting in some awfully silly displays from such a grand old firm. In the
interest of reinvention, Shell executives, according to Fortune magazine, have "helped each other
climb walls in the freezing Dutch rain. They've dug dirt at low-income housing projects and made
videotapes of themselves walking around blindfolded. They've tracked their time to figure out
whether they're adding any value. They've even taken Myers-Briggs personality tests to see who fits
in at the new Shell and who doesn't."
Part of Shell's image overhaul has involved reaching out to black communities in Europe and North
America, a strategy that has created bitter divisions in poor neighbourhoods that are desperate for
funding but suspicious of Shell's motives. For instance, in August 1997, the Oakland School Board
in California hotly debated the ethics of accepting a donation from Shell worth $2 million $100,000 for scholarships and the rest for the creation of a Shell Youth Training Academy. Since
Oakland has a large African-American population that includes exiled Nigerians, the debate was
wrenching. "Children in Nigeria don't have an opportunity to get a scholarship from Shell," said
Tunde Okorodudu, an Oakland parent and a Nigerian pro-democracy activist. "We really need
money for the children but we don't want blood money." After months of stalemate, the board (like
the Portland School Board that debated whether or not to accept Nike's donation) eventually voted
to accept the money.
But even as the new Shell goes Zen, tossing around trendy management terms like the "new ethical
paradigm," "change agents," the "third bottom line," and the "stakeholder economy," and even as
Shell Nigeria speaks of "healing the wounds," the old Shell remains. Although it has not yet
succeeded in returning to Ogoni land, Shell continues to operate in other parts of the Niger Delta,
and in the fall of 1998 tensions in the area once again erupted. The issues were all too familiar:
communities complained of polluted lands, devastated fisheries, gas fires and flaring, and of seeing
enormous profits pumped out of their oil-rich land while they continued to live in poverty. "You go
to the flow stations, you see they are very well equipped, with all modern facilities. You go to the
neighbouring village, there is no water to drink, no food to eat. That is bringing about the protests,"
explained Paul Orieware, a local politician. Only this time, Shell was up against foes far less
committed to non-violence than the Ogoni. In October, Nigerian protestors seized two Shell
helicopters, nine Shell relay stations and a drilling rig, halting, according to Associated Press, "the
transfer of some 250,000 barrels of crude a day." More Shell stations were stormed and occupied in
March 1999. Shell denied any wrongdoing and blamed the violence on ethnic conflicts.

At the same time as the anti-Shell campaigns were breaking out, the McLibel Trial, which had been
in the docket for a few years already, was turning into an international situation. In June 1995, the
trial was coming up to its first anniversary in court, when the two defendants, Helen Steel and Dave
Morris, held a press conference outside the London courthouse. They announced that McDonald's
(which had sued them for libel) had made a settlement offer. The company offered to donate money
to a cause of Steel and Morris's choice if the two outspoken environmentalists on trial would stop
criticizing McDonald's; then everyone would leave the whole messy nightmare behind them.

Steel and Morris defiantly refused the offer. They saw no reason to give in now. The trial, which
had been designed to stem the flow of negative publicity—and to gag and bankrupt Steel and
Morris —had been an epic public-relations disaster for McDonald's. It had done almost as much as
mad cow disease to promote vegetarianism, had certainly done more to raise the issue of labour
conditions in the McJob sector than any union drive and had sparked a more profound debate about
corporate censorship than any other free-speech case in recent memory.
The pamphlet at the centre of the suit was first published in 1986 by London Greenpeace, a splinter
group of Greenpeace International (which the hardcore Londoners deemed too centralized and
mainstream for their tastes). It was an early case study in using a single brand name to connect all
the dots on the social agenda: issues of rain-forest depletion (to raise the cattle), Third World
poverty (forcing peasants off their farms to make way for export crops and McDonald's livestock
needs), animal cruelty (in treatment of the livestock), waste production (disposable packaging and
litter), health (fried fatty foods), poor labour conditions (low wages and union busting in the McJob
sector) and exploitative advertising (in McDonald's target marketing to children).
But the truth is, McLibel was never really about the contents of the pamphlet. In many ways, the
case against McDonald's is less compelling than the ones against Nike and Shell, both of which are
supported by hard evidence of large-scale human suffering. With McDonald's the evidence was less
direct and, in some ways, the issues more dated. The concern about litter-producing fast-food
restaurants reached its peak in the late eighties and London Green-peace's campaign against the
company clearly came from the standpoint of meat-is-murder vegetarianism: a valid perspective,
but one for which there is a limited political constituency. What made McLibel take off as a
campaign on a par with the ones targeting Nike and Shell was not what the fast-food chain did to
cows, forests or even its own workers. The McLibel movement took off because of what
McDonald's did to Helen Steel and Dave Morris.
Franny Armstrong, who produced a documentary about the trial, points out that Britain's libel law
was changed in 1993 "so that governmental bodies such as local councils are no longer able to sue
for libel. This was to protect people's right to criticize public bodies. Multinationals are fast
becoming more powerful than governments — and even less accountable —so shouldn't the same
rules apply? With advertising budgets in the billions, it's not as though they need to turn to the law
to ensure their point of view is heard." In other words, for many of its supporters, Steel and Morris's
case was less about the merits of fast food than about the need to protect freedom of speech in a
climate of mounting corporate control. If Brent Spar was about loss of space, and Nike was about
the loss of good jobs, McLibel was about loss of voice - it was about corporate censorship.
When McDonald's issued libel writs against five Greenpeace activists in 1990 over the contents of
the now-notorious leaflet, three members of the group did what most people would do when faced
with the prospect of going up against an $11 billion corporation: they apologized. The company
had a long and successful history with this strategy. According to The Guardian: "Over the past 15
years, McDonald's has threatened legal action against more than 90 organizations in the U.K.,
including the BBC, Channel 4, the Guardian, the Sun, the Scottish TLIC, the New Leaf Tea Shop,
student newspapers and a children's theatre group. Even Prince Philip received a stiff letter. All of
them backed down and many formally apologised in court."

But Helen Steel and Dave Morris made another choice. They used the trial to launch a seven-year
experiment in riding the golden arches around the global economy. For 313 days in court — the
longest trial in English history-an unemployed postal worker (Morris) and a community gardener
(Steel) went to war with chief executives from the largest food empire in the world.
Over the course of the trial, Steel and Morris meticulously elaborated every one of the pamphlet's
claims, with the assistance of nutritional and environmental experts and scientific studies. With 180
witnesses called to the stand, the company endured humiliation after humiliation as the court heard
stories of food poisoning, failure to pay legal overtime, bogus recycling claims and corporate spies
sent to infiltrate the ranks of London Greenpeace. In one particularly telling incident, McDonald's
executives were challenged on the company's claim that it serves "nutritious food": David Green,
senior vice president of marketing, expressed his opinion that Coca-Cola is nutritious because it is
"providing water, and I think that is part of a balanced diet." In another embarrassing exchange,
McDonald's executive Ed Oakley explained to Steel that the McDonald's garbage stuffed into
landfills is "a benefit, otherwise you will end up with lots of vast empty gravel pits all over the
country."
On June 19, 1997, the judge finally handed down the verdict. The courtroom was packed with an
odd assortment of corporate executives, pink-haired vegan anarchists and rows of journalists. It felt
like an eternity to most of us sitting there, as Judge Rodger Bell read out his forty-five-page ruling
—a summary of the actual verdict, which was over a thousand pages long. Although the judge
deemed most of the pamphlet's claims too hyperbolic to be acceptable (he was particularly
unconvinced by its direct linking of McDonald's to "hunger in the Third World'"), he deemed others
to be based on pure fact. Among the decisions that went in Steel and Morris's favour were that
McDonald's "exploit(s) children" by "using them, as more susceptible subjects of advertising"; that
its treatment of some animals has been "cruel"; that it is anti-union and pays "low wages"; that its
management can be "autocratic" and "most unfair"; and that a consistent diet of McDonald's food
contributes to the risk of heart disease. Steel and Morris were ordered to pay damages to
McDonald's in the amount of US$95,490. But in March 1999 an appeals court judge found that
Judge Bell had been overly harsh and sided more forcefully with Steel and Morris on the claims
"concerning nutrition and health risks and on the allegations about pay and conditions for
McDonald's employees." Still finding that their claims about food poisoning, cancer and world
poverty were unproven, the court nonetheless lowered the amount of damages to $61,300.46
McDonald's has never tried to collect its settlement and has decided not to apply for an injunction
to halt the further dissemination of the leaflet.
After the first verdict, McDonald's was quick to declare victory, but few were convinced. "Not
since Pyrrhus has a victor emerged so bedraggled," read The Guardian's editorial the next day. "As
P.R. fiascos go, this action takes the prize for ill-judged and disproportionate response to public
criticism." In fact, while all this was going on, the original pamphlet had gathered the cachet of a
collector's item, with three million copies distributed in the U.K. alone. John Vidal had published
his critically acclaimed book McLibel: Burger Culture on Trial; 60 Minutes had produced a lengthy
segment about the trial; England's Channel 4 had run a three-hour dramatization of it; and Franny
Armstrong's documentary McLibel: Two Worlds Collide had made the rounds of the independent
film circuit (having been turned down by every major broadcaster because of—ironically —libel
concerns).

For Helen Steel, Dave Morris and their supporters, McLibel was never solely about winning in
court —it was about using the courts to win over the public. And judging by the crowds outside the
McDonald's outlets two days after the verdict came down, they had every right to be declaring
victory. Standing outside their neighbourhood McDonald's in North London on a Saturday
afternoon, Steel and Morris could barely keep up with the demand for "What's wrong with
McDonald's?" the leaflet that started it all. Passers-by requested copies, drivers pulled over to get
their McLibel mementos and mothers with toddlers stopped to talk to Helen Steel about how
difficult it can be for a busy parent when her child demands unhealthy food — what can a mother
do?
Across the United Kingdom, a similar scene was playing itself out at more than five hundred
McDonald's outlets, all of which were simultaneously picketed on June 21, 1997, along with thirty
in North America. As with the Nike protests, every event was different. At one British franchise,
the community put on a street performance featuring an axe-wielding Ronald McDonald, a cow and
lots of ketchup. At another, people passed out free vegetarian food. At all of them, supporters
handed out the famous leaflet: 400,000 copies that weekend alone. "They were flying out of their
hands," said Dan Mills of the McLibel Support Campaign, amused at the irony: before McDonald's
decided to sue, London Greenpeace's campaign was winding down, and only a few hundred copies
of the contentious leaflet had ever been distributed. It has now been translated into twenty-six
languages and is one of the hottest properties in cyberspace.

It's a good bet that many brand-name giants besides McDonald's have paid close attention to the
goings-on in that British courtroom. In 1996, Guess dropped a libel suit it had launched against the
L.A. women's group Common Threads, in response to a poetry reading about the plight of garment
workers sewing Guess jeans. Similarly, though Nike consistently accuses its critics of fabrication, it
has stayed away from trying to clear its name in court. And no wonder: the courtroom is the only
place where private corporations are forced to open shuttered windows and let the public look in.
As Helen Steel and Dave Morris write,
If companies do choose to use oppressive laws against their critics then court cases do not have to
only be about legal procedures and verdicts. They can be turned into a public forum and focus for
protest, and for the wider dissemination of the truth. This is what happened with McLibel ...Maybe
for the first time in history, a powerful institution (it just happened to be a fast-food chain, but in
some ways could've been any financial organization or state department) was subject to lengthy,
detailed and critical public scrutiny. That can only be a good thing!
The message has not been lost on Steel and Morris's fellow activists around the world; everyone
who followed McLibel saw how effective a long, dramatic trial could be at building up a body of
evidence and stoking sentiment against a corporate opponent. Some campaigners, not waiting to be
sued themselves, are taking their corporate opponents to court instead. For instance, in January
1999, when U.S. labour activists decided they wanted to draw attention to the ongoing sweatshop
violations in the U.S. territory of Saipan, they launched an unconventional lawsuit in California
court against seventeen American retailers, including the Gap and Tommy Hilfiger. The suit, filed
on behalf of thousands of Saipan garment workers, accuses the brand-name retailers and

manufacturers of participating in a "racketeering conspiracy" in which young women from
Southeast Asia are lured to Saipan with promises of well-paid jobs in the United States. What they
get instead is wage cheating and "America's worst sweatshop," in the words of Al Meyerhoff, lead
attorney on the case. A companion lawsuit further alleges that by labelling goods from Saipan
"Made in the U.S.A." or "Made in the Northern Marianas, U.S.A.," the companies are engaging in
false advertising, leaving customers with the impression that the manufacturers were subject to U.S.
labour laws, when they were not.
Meanwhile, the Centre for Constitutional Rights has taken a similar tack with Royal Dutch/Shell,
filing a federal lawsuit against the company in a New York court on the first anniversary of Ken
Saro-Wiwa's death. According to the Centre’s David A. Love, "The suit — filed on behalf of Ken
Saro-Wiwa and the other Ogoni activists who were executed by Nigeria's military regime in
November 1995-alleges that the executions were carried out with 'the knowledge, consent, and/or
support' of Shell Oil." It further alleges that the hangings were part of a conspiracy "to violently and
ruthlessly suppress any opposition to Royal Dutch/Shell's conduct in its exploitation of oil and
natural gas resources in Ogoni and in the Niger Delta." Shell denies the charges and is challenging
the legitimacy of the suit. At the time of writing, neither the Saipan case nor the Shell case had been
settled.

If the courts are becoming a popular tool to pry open closed corporations, it is the Internet that has
rapidly become the tool of choice for spreading information about multinationals around the world.
All three of the campaigns described in this chapter have distinguished themselves by a pioneering
use of information technologies, an approach that continues to unnerve their corporate targets.
Each day, information about Nike flows freely via E-mail between the U.S. National Labour
Committee and Campaign for Labour Rights; the Dutch-based Clean Clothes Campaign; the
Australian Fairwear Campaign; the Hong Kong-based Asian Monitoring and Resource Centre; the
British Labour Behind the Label Coalition and Christian Aid; the French Agir lei and Artisans du
Monde; the German Werkstatt Okonomie; the Belgian Les Magasins de Monde; and the Canadian
Maquila Solidarity Network —to name but a few of the players. In a September 1997 press release,
Nike attacked its critics as "fringe groups, which are again using the Internet and fax modems to
promote mistruths and distortions for their own purposes." But by March 1998, Nike was ready to
treat its on-line critics with a little more respect. In explaining why it had just introduced yet
another package of labour reforms, company spokesman Vada Manager said, "You make changes
because it's the right thing to do. But obviously our actions have-clearly been accelerated because
of the World Wide Web."
Shell was similarly humbled by the mobility of both the Brent Spar campaign and the Ogoni
support movement. Natural-resource companies had grown accustomed to dealing with activists
who could not escape the confines of their nationhood: a pipeline or mine could spark a peasants'
revolt in the Philippines or the Congo, but it would remain contained, reported only by the local
media and known only to people in the area. But today, every time Shell sneezes, a report goes out
on the hyperactive "shell-nigeria-action" listserve, bouncing into the in-boxes of all the far-flung
organizers involved in the campaign, from Nigerian leaders living in exile to student activists
around the world. And when a group of activists occupied part of Shell's U.K. headquarters in

January 1999, they made sure to bring a digital camera with a cellular linkup, allowing them to
broadcast their sit-in on the Web, even after Shell officials turned off the electricity and phones.
Shell has responded to the rise of Net activism with an aggressive Internet strategy of its own: in
1996, it hired Simon May, a twenty-nine-year-old "Internet manager." According to May, "There
has been a shift in the balance of power, activists are no longer entirely dependent on the existing
media. Shell learned it the hard way with the Brent Spar, when a lot of information was
disseminated outside the regular channels." But if the power balance has shifted, it is May's job to
shift it back in Shell's favour: he oversees the monitoring of all online mentions of the company,
responds to E-mail queries about social issues and has helped to establish Shell's on-line "social
concerns" discussion forum on the company Web site.
Big companies are big targets … Thousands of companies are or have been the targets of anti-corporate are or have
been the targets of anti-corporate activism online. With WeberWorks/Monitor powered by eWatch, not only will
WeberWorks/Monitor clients be altered when they become a target, they will also receive critical insights for how to
effectively handle the situation. – James M. Alexander, president of eWatch an internet monitoring company, May
1998

The Internet played a similar role during the McLibel Trial, catapulting London's grassroots antiMcDonald's movement into an arena as global as the one in which its multinational opponent
operates. "We had so much information about McDonald's, we thought we should start a library,"
Dave Morris explains, and with this in mind, a group of Internet activists launched the McSpotlight
Web site. The site not only has the controversial pamphlet online, it contains the complete 20,000page transcript of the trial, and offers a debating room where McDonald's workers can exchange
horror stories about McWork under the Golden Arches. The site, one of the most popular
destinations on the Web, has been accessed approximately sixty-five million times. Ben, one of the
studiously low-profile programmers for McSpotlight told me that "this is a medium that doesn't
require campaigners to jump through hoops doing publicity stunts, or depend on the good will of an
editor to get their message across." It's also less vulnerable to libel suits than more traditional
media. Ben explains that while McSpotlight's server is located in the Netherlands, it has "mirror
sites" in Finland, the U.S., New Zealand and Australia. That means that if a server in one country is
targeted by McDonald's lawyers, the site will still be available around the world from the other
mirrors. In the meantime, everyone visiting the site is invited to give their opinion on whether or
not McSpotlight will get sued. "Is McSpotlight next in court? Click on yes or no."
Once again, the broader corporate world is scrambling to learn the lessons of these campaigns.
Speaking in Brussels at a June 1998 conference on the growing power of Anticorporate groups,
Peter Verhille of the PR firm Entente International noted that "one of the major strengths of
pressure groups —in fact the levelling factor in their confrontation with powerful companies —is
their ability to exploit the instruments of the telecommunication revolution. Their agile use of
global tools such as the Internet reduces the advantage that corporate budgets once provided."
Indeed, the beauty of the Net for activists is that it allows coordinated international actions with
minimal resources and bureaucracy. For instance, for the International Nike Days of Action, local
activists simply download information pamphlets from the Campaign for Labour Rights Web site
to hand out at their protests, then file detailed E-mail reports from Sweden, Australia, the U.S. and
Canada, which are then forwarded to all participating groups.

A similar electronic clearinghouse model was used to coordinate both the Reclaim the Streets
global street parties and the picketing outside McDonald's outlets after the McLibel verdict. The
McSpotlight programmers posted a list of all 793 McDonald's franchises in Britain and in the
weeks before the verdict came down, local activists signed up to "adopt a store (and teach it some
respect)" on the day of protest. More than half were adopted. I had been following all of this closely
from Canada, but when I finally got a chance to see the London headquarters of the McLibel
Support Campaign —the hub from which hundreds of political actions had been launched around
the world, linking up thousands of protestors and becoming a living archive for all things antiMcDonald's — I was shocked. In my mind, I had pictured an office crammed with people tapping
away on high-tech equipment. I should have known better: McLibel's head office is nothing more
than a tiny room at the back of a London flat with graffiti in the stairwells. The office walls are
papered in subvertisements and anarchist agitprop. Helen Steel, Dave Morris, Dan Mills and a few
dozen volunteers had gone head to head with McDonald's for seven years with a rickety PC, an old
modem, one telephone and a fax machine. Dan Mills apologized to me for the absence of an extra
chair.
Tony Juniper of Britain's environmental group Friends of the Earth calls the Internet "the most
potent weapon in the toolbox of resistance." That may well be so, but the Met is more than an
organizing tool — it has become an organizing model, a blueprint for decentralized but cooperative
decision making. It facilitates the process of information sharing to such a degree that many groups
can work in concert with one another without the need to achieve monolithic consensus (which is
often impossible, anyway, given the nature of activist organizations). And because it is so
decentralized, these movements are still in the process of forging links with their various wings
around the world, continually surprising themselves with how far unreported little victories have
travelled, how thoroughly bits of research have been recycled and absorbed. These movements are
only now starting to feel their own reach and, as the students and local communities profiled in the
next chapter will show, their own power.

"Okay. I need people on each door. Let's go!" shouted Scan Hayes in the distinctive clipped
baritone of a high-school basketball coach, which, as it happens, he is. "Let's go!" Coach Hayes
bellowed again, clapping his meaty hands loud enough for the sound to bounce off the walls of the
huge gymnasium of St. Mary's Secondary School in Pickering, Ontario (a town best known for its
proximity to a nuclear power plant of questionable quality).
Hayes had invited me to participate in the school's first "Sweatshop Fashion Show," an event he
began planning when he discovered that the basketball team's made-in-lndonesia Nike sneakers had
likely been manufactured under sweatshop conditions. He's an unapologetic jock with a conscience
and, together with a handful of do-gooder students, had organized today's event to get the other two
thousand kids at St. Mary's to think about the clothes they wear in terms beyond "cool" or "lame."
The plan was simple: as student models decked out in logowear strutted down a makeshift runway,
another student off to the side would read a prepared narration about the lives of the Third World
workers who made the gear. The students would quickly follow that with scenes from Mickey
Mouse Goes to Haiti and a skit about how teenagers often feel "unloved, unwanted, unacceptable
and unpopular if you do not have the right clothes." My part would come at the end, when I was to
give a short speech about my research in export processing zones, and then facilitate a questionand-answer period. It sounded straightforward enough.
While we were waiting for the bell to ring and the students to stream in, Hayes turned to me and
said, with a forced smile: "I hope the kids actually hear the message and don't think it's just a
regular fashion show." Having read the students' prepared narration I couldn't help thinking that his
concern sounded, frankly, paranoid. True, fashion shows have become such a high-school stalwart
that they now rival car washes as the prom fundraiser of choice. But did Hayes actually think his
students were so heartless that they could listen to testimony about starvation wages and physical
abuse and expect that the clothing in question would be on sale at a discount after the assembly?
Just then, a couple of teenage boys poked their heads in the door and checked out the frantic
preparations. "Yo, guys," one of them said. "I'm guessing fashion show —this should be a joke."
Coach Hayes looked nervous.
As two thousand students piled onto the bleachers, the room came alive with the giddiness that
accompanies all mass reprieves from class, whether for school plays, AIDS education lectures,

teachers' strikes or fire alarms. A quick scan of the room turned up no logos on these kids, but that
was definitely not by choice. St. Mary's is a Catholic school and the students wear uniforms —
bland affairs that they were nonetheless working for all they were worth. It's hard to make grey
flannel slacks and acrylic navy sweaters look like gangsta gear but the guys were doing their best,
wearing their pants pulled down halfway to their knees with patterned boxer shorts bunched over
their belts. The girls were pushing the envelope too, pairing their drab tunics with platform loafers
and black lipstick.
As it turned out, Coach Hayes's concerns were well founded. As the hip-hop started playing and the
first kids bounded down the runway in Nike shoes and workout wear, the assembly broke into
cheers and applause. The moment the young woman saddled with reading the earnest voice-over
began, "Welcome to the world of Nike..." she was drowned out by hoots and whistles. It didn't take
much to figure out that they weren't cheering for her but rather at the mere mention of the word
Nike — everyone's favourite celebrity brand.
Waiting for my cue, I was ready to flee the modern teenage world forever, but after some booming
threats from Coach Hayes, the crowd finally quieted down. My speech was at least not booed and
the discussion that followed was among the liveliest I've ever witnessed. The first question (as at all
Sweatshop 101 events) was "What brands are sweatshop-free?" —Adidas? they asked. Reebok?
The Gap? I told the St. Mary's students that shopping for an exploitation-free wardrobe at the mall
is next to impossible, given the way all the large brands produce. The best way to make a
difference, I told them, is to stay informed by surfing the Net, and by letting companies know what
you think by writing letters and asking lots of questions at the store. The St. Mary's kids were
deeply sceptical of this non-answer. "Look, I don't have time to be some kind of major political
activist every time I go to the mall," one girl said, right hand planted firmly on right hip. "Just tell
me what kind of shoes are okay to buy, okay?"
Another girl, who looked about sixteen, sashayed to the microphone. "I'd just like to say that this is
capitalism, okay, and people are allowed to make money and if you don't like it maybe you're just
jealous."
The hands shot up in response. "No, I'd just like to say that you are totally screwed up and just
because everyone is doing something doesn't mean it's right —you've got to stand up for what you
believe in instead of just standing in front of the mirror trying to look good!"
After watching thousands of Ricki and Oprah episodes, these kids take to the talk-show format as
naturally as Elizabeth Dole. Just as they had cheered for Nike moments before, the students now
cheered for each other —dog-pound style, with lots of "you-go-girls." Moments before the bell for
next period, Coach Hayes made time for one last question. A boy in saggy slacks sauntered across
the gym holding his standard-issue navy blue sweater away from his lanky body with two fingers,
as if he detected a foul odour. Then, he slouched down to the mike and said, in an impeccable
teenage monotone, "Umm, Coach Hayes, if working conditions are so bad in Indonesia, then why
do we have to wear these uniforms? We buy thousands of these things and it says right here that
they are 'Made in Indonesia.' I'd just like to know, how do you know they weren't made in
sweatshops?"

The auditorium exploded. It was a serious burn. Another student rushed to the mike and suggested
that the students should try to find out who makes their uniforms, a project for which there was no
shortage of volunteers. When I left St. Mary's that day, the school had its work cut out for it.
There's no denying that the motivation behind the St. Mary's students' new-found concern over
Indonesian labour conditions was that they had just discovered a high-minded excuse to refuse to
wear their lame-ass uniforms — not an entirely selfless concern. But even if it was inadvertent, they
had also stumbled across one of the most powerful levers being used to pry reform out of seemingly
amoral multinational corporations.
When high schools, universities, places of worship, unions, city councils and other levels of
government apply ethical standards to their bulk purchasing decisions, it takes Anticorporate
campaigning a significant step beyond the mostly symbolic warfare of adbusting and superstore
protesting. Such community institutions are not only collections of individual consumers, they are
also consumers themselves — and powerful ones at that. Thousands of schools like St. Mary's
ordering thousands of uniforms each — it adds up to a lot of uniforms. They also buy sports
equipment for their teams, food for their cafeterias and drinks for their vending machines.
Municipal governments buy uniforms for their police forces, gas for their garbage trucks and
computers for their offices; and they also invest their pension funds on the stock market.
Universities, for their part, select telecommunications companies for their Internet portals, use
banks to hold their money and invest endowments that can represent billions of dollars. And, of
course, they are also increasingly involved in direct sponsorship arrangements with corporations.
Most important, bulk institutional purchases and sponsorship deals are among the most sought after
contracts in the marketplace, and corporations are forever trying to outbid one another to land them.
What all these business arrangements have in common is that they exist at a distinctive intersection
between civic life (ostensibly governed by principles of "public good") and the corporate profitmaking motive. When corporations sponsor an event on a university campus or sign a deal with a
municipal government, they cross an important line between private and public space - a line that is
not part of a consumer's interaction with a corporation as an individual shopper. We don't expect
morality at the mall but, to some extent, we do still expect it in our public spaces —in our schools,
national parks and municipal playgrounds.
So while it may be cold comfort to some, there is a positive side effect of the fact that, increasingly,
private corporations are staking a claim to these public spaces. Over the past four years, there has
been a collective realization among many public, civic and religious institutions that having a
multinational corporation as a guest in your house —whether as a supplier or a sponsor — presents
an important political opportunity. With their huge buying power, public and non-profit institutions
can exert real public-interest pressure on otherwise freewheeling private corporations. This is
nowhere more true than in the schools and universities.

As we have already seen, soft-drink, sneaker and fast-food companies have been forging a flurry of
exclusive logo allegiances with high schools, colleges and universities. Like the Olympic games,
many universities have "official" airlines, banks, long-distance carriers and computer suppliers. For
the sponsoring companies, these exclusive arrangements offer opportunities to foster warm and

fuzzy logo loyalties during those formative college years - not to mention a chance to pick up some
quasi-academic legitimacy. (Being the official supplier of a top-flight university sounds almost as if
a panel of tenured professors got together and scientifically determined that Coke Is It! or Our Fries
Are Crispier! For some lucky corporations, it can be like getting an honorary degree.)
However, these same corporations have at times discovered that there can be an unanticipated
downside to these "partnerships": that the sense of ownership that goes along with sponsoring is not
always the kind of passive consumer allegiance that the companies had bargained for. In a climate
of mounting concern about corporate ethics, students are finding that a great way to grab the
attention of aloof multinationals is to kick up a fuss about the extracurricular activities of their
university's official brand - whether Coke, Pepsi, Nike, McDonald's, Starbucks or Northern
Telecom. Rather than simply complaining about amorphous "corporatization," young activists have
begun to use their status as sought-after sponsorees to retaliate against forces they considered
invasive on their campuses to begin with. In this volatile context, a particularly aggressive
sponsorship deal can act as a political catalyst, instigating wide-ranging debate on everything from
unfair labour conditions to trading with dictators. Just ask Pepsi.
Pepsi (as we saw in Chapter 4) has been at the forefront of the drive to purchase students as a
captive market. Its exclusive vending arrangements have paved the way for copycat deals, and fastfood outlets owned by PepsiCo were among the first to establish a presence in high schools and on
university campuses in North America. One of Pepsi's first campus vending deals was with
Ottawa's Carleton University in 1993. Since marketing on campus was still somewhat jarring back
then, many students were immediately resentful at being forced into this tacit product endorsement,
and were determined not to give their official drink a warm welcome. Members of the university's
chapter of the Public Interest and Research Group — a network of campus social-justice
organizations stretching across North America known as PIRGs — discovered that PepsiCo was
producing and selling its soft drinks in Burma, the brutal dictatorship now called Myanmar. The
Carleton students weren't sure how to deal with the information, so they posted a notice about
Pepsi's involvement in Burma on a few on-line bulletin boards that covered student issues.
Gradually, other universities where Pepsi was the official drink started requesting more
information. Pretty soon, the Ottawa group had developed and distributed hundreds of "campus
action kits," with pamphlets, petitions, and "Gotta Boycott" and "Pepsi, Stuff It" stickers. "How can
you help free Burma?" one pamphlet asks. "Pressure schools to terminate food or beverage
contracts selling PepsiCo products until it leaves Burma."
Many students did just that. As a result, in April 1996 Harvard rejected a proposed $1 million
vending deal with Pepsi, citing the company's Burma holdings. Stanford University cost Pepsi an
estimated $800,000 when a petition signed by two thousand students blocked the construction of a
PepsiCo-owned Taco Bell restaurant. The stakes were even higher in Britain where campus softdrink contracts are coordinated centrally through the National Union of Students' services wing.
"Pepsi had just beat out Coke for the contract," recalls Guy Hughes, a campaigner with the Londonbased group Third World First. "Pepsi was being sold in eight hundred student unions across the
U.K., so we used the consortium as a lever to pressure Pepsi. When [the student union] met with the
company, one factor for Pepsi was that the boycott had become international."

Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of Burma's opposition party that was elected to power in 1990, only
to be prevented from taking office by the military, has offered encouragement to this nascent
movement. In 1997, in a speech read by her husband (who has since died) at the American
University in Washington, D.C., she singled out students in the call to put pressure on multinational
corporations that are invested in Burma. "Please use your liberty to promote ours," she said. "Take
a principled stand against companies which are doing business with the military regime of Burma.”
After the campus boycotts made it into The New York Times, Pepsi sold its shares in a
controversial Burmese bottling plant whose owner, Thien Tun, had publicly called for Suu Kyi's
democracy movement to be "ostracized and crushed." Student activists, however, dismissed the
move as a "paper shuffle" because Pepsi products were still being sold and produced in Burma.
Finally, facing continued pressure, Pepsi announced its "total disengagement" from Burma on
January 24, 1997. When Zar Ni, the coordinator of the American student movement, heard the
news, he sent an E-mail out on the Free Burma Coalition listserve: "We finally tied the Pepsi
Animal down! We did it!! We all did it!!!... We now KNOW we have the grassroots power to yank
one of the most powerful corporations in the world."
If there is a moral to this story, it is that Pepsi's drive to capture the campus market landed the
company at the centre of a debate in which it had no desire to participate. It wanted university
students to be its poster children — its real live Generation Next —but instead, the students turned
the tables and made Pepsi the poster corporation for their campus Free Burma movement. Sein
Win, a leader in exile of Burma's elected National League for Democracy, observed that "PepsiCo
very much takes care of its image. It wanted to press the drink's image as 'the taste of a young
generation,' so when the young generation participates in boycotts, it hurts the effort." Simon
Billenness, an ethical investment specialist who spearheaded the Burma campaign, is more blunt:
"Pepsi," he says, "was under siege from its own target market." And Reid Cooper, coordinator of
the Carleton University campaign, notes that without Pepsi's thirst for campus branding, Burma's
plight might never have become an issue on campuses. "Pepsi tried to go into the schools," he tells
me in an interview, "and from there it was spontaneous combustion."
Not surprisingly, the Pepsi victory has emboldened the Free Burma campaign on the campuses. The
students have adopted the slogan "Burma: South Africa of the Nineties" and claim to be "The
largest human rights campaign in cyberspace." Today, more than one hundred colleges and twenty
high schools around the world are part of the Free Burma Coalition. The extent to which the
country's liberty has become a student cause celebre became apparent when, in August 1998,
eighteen foreign activists — most of them university students —were arrested in Rangoon for
handing out leaflets expressing support for Burma's democracy movement. Not surprisingly, the
event caught the attention of the international media. The court sentenced the activists to five years
of hard labour, but at the last minute deported them instead of imprisoning them.
Other student campaigns have focused on different corporations and different dictators. With Pepsi
out of Burma, attention began to shift on campuses to Coca-Cola's investments in Nigeria. At Kent
State University and other schools where Coke won the campus cola war, students argued that
Coke's high-profile presence in Nigeria offered an air of legitimacy to the country's illegitimate
military regime (which, at the time, was still in power). Once again, the issue of Nigerian human
rights might never have reached much beyond KSU's Amnesty International Club, but because

Coke and the school had entered into a sponsorship-style arrangement, the campaign took off and
students began shouting that their university had blood on its hands.
There have also been a number of food fights, most of them related to McDonald's expanding
presence on college campuses. In 1997, the British National Union of Students entered into an
agreement with McDonald's to distribute "privilege cards" to all undergraduates in the U.K. When
students showed the card, they got a free cheeseburger every time they ordered a Big Mac, fries and
drink. But campus environmentalists opposed the deal, forcing the student association to bow out of
the marketing alliance in March 1998. In providing its reasons for the change of heart, the
association cited the company's "anti-union practices, exploitation of employees, its contribution to
the destruction of the environment, animal cruelty and the promotion of unhealthy food products"
— all carefully worded references to the McLibel judge's findings.
As the brand backlash spreads, students are beginning to question not only sponsorship
arrangements with the likes of McDonald's and Pepsi, but also the less flashy partnerships that their
universities have with the private sector. Whether it's bankers on the board of governors, corporateendowed professorships or the naming of campus buildings after benefactors, all are facing scrutiny
from a more economically politicized student body. British students have stepped up a campaign to
pressure their universities to stop accepting grant money from the oil industry, and in British
Columbia, the University of Victoria Senate voted in November 1998 to refuse scholarship money
from Shell. This agenda of corporate resistance is gradually becoming more structured, as students
from across North America come together at annual conferences such as the 1997 "Democracy
Teach-in: Campus Democracy vs. Corporate Control" at the University of Chicago, where they
attend seminars like "Research: For People or Profit?" "Investigating Your Campus" and "What Is a
Corporation and Why Is There a Problem?" In June 1999, student activists again came together, this
time in Toledo, Ohio, in the newly formed Student Alliance to Reform Corporations. The purpose
of the gathering was to launch a national campaign to force universities to invest their money only
with companies that respect human rights and do not degrade the environment.
It should come as no surprise that by far the most controversial campus-corporate partnerships have
been ones involving that most controversial of companies: Nike. Since the shoe industry's use of
sweatshop labour became common knowledge, the deals that Nike had signed with hundreds of
athletic departments in universities have become among the most contentious issues on campuses
today, with "Ban the Swoosh" buttons rivalling women's symbols as the undergraduate accessory of
choice. And in what Nike must see as the ultimate slap in the face, college campuses where the
company has paid out millions of dollars to sponsor sports teams (University of North Carolina,
Duke University, Stanford, Penn State and Arizona State, to name just a few) have become the
hottest spots of the international anti-Mike campaign. According to the Campaign for Labour
Rights, "These contracts, which are a centrepiece of Nike marketing, have now turned into a public
relations nightmare for the company. Nike's aggressive campus marketing has now been forced into
a defensive posture."
At the University of Arizona, students attempted to get their university president to reconsider the
school's endorsement of Nike products by delivering a pile of old Nike shoes to his office (followed
by cameras from two local television stations). According to a student organizer, James Tracy,
"each pair of shoes had a tale of Nike's abuse attached to them for the president to consider." At

Stanford University, similar protests greeted the athletic department's decision to sign a four-year,
$5 million contract with Nike. In fact, bashing Nike has become such a popular sport on campus
that at Florida State University— a major jock college —a group of students built an anti-Nike float
for the 1997 homecoming parade.
Most of these universities are locked into multiyear sponsorship deals with Nike, but at the
University of California at Irvine, students went after the company when its contract with the
women's basketball team was up for renewal. Faced with mounting pressure from the student body,
the school's athletic department decided to switch to Converse. On another campus, soccer coach
Kim Keady was unable to persuade his employer, St. John's University, to stop forcing its team to
use Nike gear. So, in the summer of 1998, he quit his job as assistant coach in protest.
University of North Carolina student Marion Traub-Werner explains the appeal of this new
movement: "Obviously there's the labour issue. But we're also concerned about Nike's intrusion
into our campus culture. The swoosh is everywhere — in addition to all the uniforms, it's on the
game schedules, it's on all the posters and it dominates the clothing section in the campus store."
Like no other company, Nike has branded this generation, and so if students now have the chance
to brand Nike as an exploiter —well, the chance is too good to pass up.

While many campuses are busily taking on the brand-name interlopers, others are realizing that
their universities are themselves brand names. Ivy League universities, and colleges with all-star
sports teams, have extensive clothing lines, several of which rival the market share of many
commercial designers. They also share many of the same labour problems. In 1998, the UNITE
garment workers union published a report on the BJ&B factory in an export processing zone in the
Dominican Republic. Workers at BJ&B, one of the world's largest manufacturers of baseball hats,
embroider the school logos and crests of at least nine large American universities, including
Cornell, Duke, Georgetown, Harvard and University of Michigan. The conditions at BJ&B were
signature free-trade-zone ones: long hours of forced overtime, fierce union busting (including
layoffs of organizers), short-term contracts, pay checks insufficient to feed a family, pregnancy
tests, sexual harassment, abusive management, unsafe drinking water and huge mark-ups (while the
hats sold, on average, for $19.95, workers saw only 8 cents of that)." And of course, most of the
workers were young women, a fact that was brought home when the union sponsored a trip to the
U.S. for two former employees of the factory: nineteen-year-old Kenia Rodriguez and twenty-yearold Roselio Reyes. The two workers visited many of the universities whose logos they used to
stitch on caps, speaking to gatherings of students who were exactly their age. "In the name of the
2,050 workers in this factory, and the people in this town, we ask for your support," Reyes said to
an audience of students at the University of Illinois.
These revelations about factory conditions were hardly surprising. College licensing is big
business, and the players —Fruit of the Loom, Champion, Russell — have all shifted to contract
factories with the rest of the garment industry, and make liberal use of free-trade zones around the
world. In the U.S., the licensing of college names is a $2.5 billion annual industry, much of it
brokered through the Collegiate Licensing Company. Duke University alone sells around $25
million worth of clothing associated with its winning basketball team every year. To meet the

demand, it has seven hundred licensees who contract to hundreds of plants in the U.S. and in ten
other countries.
Because of Duke's leading role as a campus apparel manufacturer, a group of activists decided to
turn the school into a model of ethical manufacturing — not only for other schools, but for the
scandal-racked garment industry as a whole. In March 1998, Duke University unveiled a landmark
policy requiring that all companies making T-shirts, baseball hats and sweatshirts bearing the
"Duke" name agree to a set of clear labour standards. The code required that contractors pay the
legal minimum wage, maintain safe working conditions and allow workers to form unions, no
matter where the factories were located. What makes the policy more substantial than most other
codes in the garment sector is that it requires factories to undergo inspections from independent
monitors — a provision that sent Nike and Shell screaming from the negotiating table, despite
overwhelming evidence that their stated standards are being disregarded on the ground. Brown
University followed two months later with a tough code of its own.
Tico Almeida, a senior at Duke University, explains that many students have a powerful reaction
when they learn about the workers who produce their team clothing in free-trade zones. "You have
two groups of people, roughly the same age, who are getting such different experiences out of the
same institutions," he says. And once again, says David Tannenbaum, an undergraduate at
Princeton, the logo (this time a school logo) provides the global link. "While the workers are
making our clothes thousands of miles away, in other ways we're close to it —we're wearing these
clothes every day."
The summer after the Duke and Brown codes were passed was filled with activity. In July, antisweatshop organizers from campuses across the country gathered in New York and organized
themselves into a coalition, United Students Against Sweatshops. In August, a delegation of eight
students, including Tico Almeida, went on a fact-finding mission to free-trade zones in Nicaragua,
El Salvador and Honduras. Almeida told me he was hoping to find Duke sweatshirts because he
had seen the "Made in Honduras" tag on clothing sold on his campus. But he soon discovered what
most people do when they visit free-trade zones: that a potent combination of secrecy, deferred
responsibility and militarism forms a protective barricade around much of the global garment
industry. "It was like taking random stabs in the dark," he recalls.
When classes resumed in September 1998 and the student travellers were back on campus, the issue
of sweatshop labour exploded into what The New York Times described as "the biggest surge in
campus activism in nearly two decades." At Duke, Georgetown, Wisconsin, North Carolina,
Arizona, Michigan, Princeton, Stanford, Harvard, Brown, Cornell and University of California at
Berkeley there were conferences, teach-ins, protests and sit-ins — some lasting three and four days.
At Yale University, students held a "knit-in." All the demonstrations led to agreements from school
administrators to demand higher labour standards from the companies that manufacture their wares.
This fast-growing movement has a somewhat unlikely rallying cry: "Corporate disclosure." The
central demand is for the companies that produce college-affiliated clothing to hand over the names
and addresses of all their factories around the world and open themselves up to monitoring. Who
makes your school clothing, the students say, should not be a mystery. They argue that with the
garment industry being the global, contracted-out maze that it is, the onus must be on companies to
prove their goods aren't made in sweatshops — not on investigative activists to prove that they are.

The students are also pushing for their schools to demand that contractors pay a "living wage," as
opposed to the legal minimum wage. By May 1999, at least four administrations had agreed in
principle to push their suppliers on the living-wage issue. As we will see in the next chapter, there
is no agreement about how to turn those well-meaning commitments into real changes in the export
factories. Everyone involved in the anti-sweatshop movement does agree, however, that even
getting issues like disclosure and a living wage on the negotiating table with manufacturers
represents a major victory, one that has eluded campaigners for many years.
In a smaller but equally precedent-setting initiative, Archbishop Theodore McCarrick announced in
October 1997 that his Newark, New Jersey, archdiocese would become a "no sweat" zone. The
initiative includes introducing an anti-sweatshop curriculum into all 185 Catholic schools in the
area, identifying the manufacturers of all their school uniforms and monitoring them to make sure
the clothes are being produced under fair labour conditions -just as the students at St. Mary's in
Pickering, Ontario, decided to do.
All in all, students have picked up the gauntlet on the sweatshop issue with an enthusiasm that has
taken the aging labour movement by storm. United Students Against Sweatshops, after only one
year in existence, claimed chapters on a hundred U.S. campuses and a sister network in Canada.
Free the Children, young Craig Kielburger's Toronto-based anti-child-labour organization (he was
the thirteen-year-old who challenged the Canadian prime minister to review child-labour practices
in India) has meanwhile gained strength in high schools and grade schools around the world.
Charles Ker-naghan, with his "outing" of Kathie Lee Gifford and Mickey Mouse, may have started
this wave of labour organizing, but by the end of the 1998-99 academic year, he knew he was no
longer driving it. In a letter to the United Students Against Sweatshops, he wrote: "Right now it is
your student movement which is leading the way and carrying the heaviest weight in the struggle to
end sweatshop abuses and child labour. Your effectiveness is forcing the companies to respond."
Times have changed. As William Cahn writes in his history of the Lawrence Mill sweatshop strike
of 1912, "Nearby Harvard University allowed students credit for their midterm examinations if they
agreed to serve in the militia against the strikers. Insolent, well-fed Harvard men,' the New York
Call reported, 'parade up and down, their rifles loaded ...their bayonets glittering.'" Today, students
are squarely on the other side of sweatshop labour disputes: as the target market for everything
from Guess jeans to Nike soccer balls and Duke-embossed baseball hats, young people are taking
the sweatshop issue personally.

Since federal governments in North America and Europe have been largely unwilling to impose
meaningful sanctions on such documented human-rights violators as Burma, Nigeria, Indonesia and
China, preferring instead to "constructively engage" these nations with trade, there has been a move
for more local levels of government to step in where the feds have stepped aside. In the U.S., town
councils, city councils, school boards and even some individual state governments have been
quietly doing an end run around the trade-mission cheerleading that now passes for foreign policy,
and drafting their own, local, foreign policy.
Local legislators know that they can't keep multinationals from channeling funds to dictatorships in
Nigeria and Burma, and they cannot prevent imports from companies that use child and prison

labour in Pakistan and China, but they can do something else. They can collectively refuse to buy
goods and services from these companies when they select their business partners for everything
from cellular services to Little League soccer balls. The goal of "selective purchasing agreements,"
as these ethical trading policies are called, is twofold. First, the agreements may lead individual
companies to decide that it is not cost-effective to continue to do business under unethical
conditions abroad — for instance, if it is going to cost them contracts at home. Second, actions by
local governments can put pressure on federal governments to take more principled positions in
their foreign policy agendas.
Modelled after similar initiatives during the anti-apartheid years, the current local foreign policy
"fad" (as one Republican commentator snidely called it) began, like so many other U.S. socialjustice movements, in Berkeley, California. In February 1995, Berkeley's city council passed a
resolution barring the purchase of goods or services from companies invested in Burma. Of course
such companies could still sell their wares inside Berkeley —just not to municipal agencies, such as
the police force or sanitation services. The move set off a domino effect across the country — at
last count, twenty-two cities, one county and two states had selective purchasing agreements
relating to companies in Burma, and a handful of cities had disqualified purchases from companies
with investments in Nigeria.
Though each law has slight variations in wording, the gist is summed up in this one, passed
unanimously by the City of Cambridge, Massachusetts, on June 8, 1998:
WHEREAS
The city of Cambridge declares the right to measure the moral character of its business partners in
determining with whom it seeks to have business relationships; now therefore be it
RESOLVED
That as a matter of public policy the City of Cambridge declares that it will not purchase goods,
services or commodities from any company or corporation that does business in the nation of
Burma...
The most significant move came in June 1996 when the Massachusetts State Legislature passed the
Massachusetts Burma Law, making it far more difficult for companies doing business in the
dictator-run country to land a government contract in the state. As the influential Journal of
Commerce noted, "The targets are far from home, but suddenly local governments are showing they
can reach around the world."
Another popular purchasing restriction is one that does not broadly target all corporations in
particular countries, but rather corporations engaged in a particularly objectionable practice — for
instance, the practice of employing sweatshop or child labour. One such case involved the Los
Angeles Monroe High School. After reading the Life magazine article on the Pakistani soccer-ball
industry, a Monroe student, Sharon Paulson, recalled that she and her classmates "ran out during
one practice and we were checking all the balls and they all said, 'Made in Pakistan.' That kind of
made everything more real. Before, it was something that we read about, but then it was like, 'We
won a city championship using these balls!' It gave us something to fight for." What they fought for
— and won —was a commitment from the Los Angeles Board of Education to halt an order of balls
made in Pakistan, and another from Los Angeles City Council "to investigate the production of

soccer balls made in countries using child labour." According to the Investor Responsibility
Research Centre, "in 1997, some 20 U.S. cities and towns... adopted 'anti-sweatshop' ordinances
that require that goods purchased by those city governments — including uniforms for police, fire
and public works personnel—be made without sweatshop labour."
Though selective purchasing agreements have been primarily an American phenomenon, they are
beginning to pop up elsewhere. The city of St. John's, Newfoundland, passed an anti-sweatshop
resolution in June 1998, and a group of kids in Fort McMurray, Alberta, succeeded in getting their
city council to pass a resolution banning the use of child-made soccer balls and fireworks on public
property. Free Burma resolutions, meanwhile, are reaching even farther —on March 17, 1998, the
Marrickville Council in New South Wales, Australia, "voted unanimously to become the first local
authority outside the United States to enact a Burma selective purchasing law."
In the past four years, the Berkeley City Council has passed so many boycott resolutions —against
companies doing business in Burma, Nigeria, Tibet; companies associated with the arms industry or
with nuclear power -that, as Councillor Polly Armstrong joked, "Pretty soon we'll have to do our
own offshore drilling." It's true that between the Nigeria and Burma resolutions, and one about the
Exxon Valdez oil spill, the council is prevented from using every single major oil company and is
forced to fuel its ambulances and street-cleaning vehicles with gas from the little-known Golden
Gate Petroleum Company. Berkeley banished Pepsi from its municipal vending machines because
of its investment in Burma, returned to the company after it cut ties with Rangoon and then decided
to boycott Coke because of its involvement in Nigeria.
It may all sound like Alice in Wonderland, but the boycotts do affect the multinationals. They may
smile at a tie-dyed college town like Berkeley boycotting everything but hemp paper and
Bridgehead coffee, but when rich states like Massachusetts and Vermont get in on the action, the
corporate sector is not amused. In May 1999, three more states — Texas, Washington and New
York —had Burma laws pending. And it was beginning to cost. For instance, before it pulled out of
Burma over the Celine Dion controversy, the telecommunication firm Ericsson lost a major bid to
upgrade San Francisco's 911 services because of its business ties with Burma, and Hewlett-Packard
is alleged to have lost several large municipal contracts as well.
Understandably, many companies have bowed to the demands of the human-rights campaigners.
Since Massachusetts adopted its Burma Law in June 1996, there has been an exodus of big-name
multinationals from the dictatorship, including Eastman Kodak, Hewlett-Packard, Philips
Electronics, Apple computers and Texaco. But just because these companies decided to give in
does not mean they plan to accept these new local roadblocks in international commercial
transactions without a fight. As Robert S. Greenberger explains in The Wall Street Journal,
"Procurement contracts in California alone, for example, are worth more to some U.S. companies
than any business they could secure in many countries, but they don't want to have to choose".
Precisely because it forces such a stark choice, many people are convinced that localized foreign
policy initiatives are the most effective political tool available for wresting back some control over
transnational corporations. "Selective purchasing based on the Burma model," says Danny
Kennedy, coordinator of mining lobby group Project Underground, "is our greatest hope."

It's the kind of statement that has come to enrage the business community, which, after being
caught off guard by the sudden rise of selective purchasing laws, is determined not to make the
same mistake twice. A coalition of companies, including key Burma investors such as Unocal, and
Nigeria investors such as Mobil, have banded together under the National Foreign Trade Council to
launch an all-out assault on local selective purchasing agreements. In April 1997, the council
formed USA*Engage, claiming to represent over 670 corporations and trade associations. Its
express purpose is to fight these laws collectively, allowing individual corporations to avoid putting
their own practices in the firing line. Frank Kittredge, who is both president of the NFTC and vice
chairman of USA*Engage, explains that "a lot of companies are not anxious to be spotlighted as
supporters of countries like Iran or Burma. The way to avoid that is to band together in a coalition."
The group argues that foreign policy is a federal matter, and municipal and state governments have
no business wading into the fray. To these ends, USA*Engage has developed a "State and Local
Sanctions Watch List" to monitor all the towns, cities and states where selective purchasing
agreements have passed, as well as communities that are considering passing them and are therefore
still vulnerable to outside pressure. Aggressive lobbying by USA*Engage members has already
succeeded in squashing a proposed law on Nigeria that was about to be adopted by the State of
Maryland (in March 1998); and Unocal (which has not managed to keep its name out of this
debate) succeeded in convincing the California state legislature not to adopt a Massachusetts-style
Burma law.
The attacks have also come from farther afield. Acting at the behest of multinationals based in
Europe, the European Union has launched an official challenge to the Massachusetts Burma Law at
the World Trade Organization. At issue is the allegation that the law violates a WTO regulation that
prohibits government purchases from being made on "political" grounds. There has even been talk
that municipal and state governments in the U.S. could be sued by their own federal government for
violating the WTO clause. Though federal legislators categorically deny that is their intention, on
August 5, 1998, Congress narrowly defeated a resolution that would have barred the government
from using public money for such a court challenge.
While this trade wrangling went on, the multinationals didn't wait around to see if the selective
purchasing agreements would survive. In April 1998, the National Foreign Trade Council filed a
lawsuit in the federal district court in Boston that challenged the Massachusetts Burma Law as
unconstitutional. The NFTC argued that "the Massachusetts Burma Law directly intrudes on the
exclusive power of the national government to determine foreign policy, discriminates against
companies engaged in foreign commerce, and conflicts with the policies and objectives of the
federal statute imposing sanctions on the Union of Myanmar." Though the NFTC succeeded in
winning a protective order that concealed the identities of the individual corporations funding the
case, it claimed in court that thirty of its members had been affected by the law. And in November
1998, the NFTC won: the court ruled the Massachusetts Burma Law unconstitutional because it
"impermissibly infringes on the federal government's power to regulate foreign affairs."
The state has already lost one appeal, but both sides have said they are willing to take the case all
the way to the Supreme Court. The NFTC openly acknowledges that the court challenge is an
attempt to set a precedent that would effectively stamp out all municipal selective purchasing
agreements, as well as campus and school-board bans. "We regard this law suit to be an important

test case that will determine the very significant, perplexing and continuing issue concerning the
constitutionality of state and local sanctions," said Frank Kittredge.
For their part, proponents of selective purchasing argue that they are not trying to implement their
own foreign policy. They say calling these laws "sanctions," as their critics invariably do, is a
misnomer because selective purchasing agreements are not regulations placed on businesses, they
are simply large-scale consumer pressure. Simon Billenness, the Burma campaigner who has
helped draft these pieces of legislation, characterizes them colourfully as "boycotts on steroids."
Just as consumers have the right to personal choice in the marketplace, so too do they have the right
collectively, whether as schools, town councils or state governments. He also points out that the
agreements have a proven track record of meaningful human-rights victories. During the antiapartheid movement, five U.S. states, nine cities and fifty-nine universities passed resolutions that
either barred purchases from companies in South Africa outright, or compelled them to adopt the
Sullivan principles. "If USA*Engage had succeeded with their tactics during the apartheid years,
Nelson Mandela might still be in prison," says Simon Billenness. Perhaps most important, the
assault on selective purchasing agreements has turned what were campaigns on behalf of citizens in
faraway lands into battles for local rights and liberties as well. Billenness, for his part, describes the
attempt to criminalize selective purchasing as "a violation of state sovereignty and local
democracy." It may also prove a tactical miscalculation. In taking aim at these locally based
actions, the NFTC has actively reinforced the very beliefs that led to their enactment in the first
place: that corporations have become more powerful than governments; that federal governments
have stopped serving the interests of people; and that in the light of these two facts, citizens have no
choice but to confront corporate power themselves.
The proposed Multilateral Agreement on Investment would not help matters. The MA1 is stalled
for the moment, but its supporters have in no way abandoned the project. According to a draft
leaked in 1997, selective purchasing agreements could become instantly illegal. The agreement
explicitly bans "discrimination" against corporations based on their trade relations with other
countries, and states clearly that this clause would override any pre-existing laws at all levels of
government — including municipalities. Not only that, but multinationals would be granted the
legal standing to sue governments directly for any alleged discrimination on this basis. Many now
believe that these parts of the MA1 will be part of the next round of World Trade Organization
negotiations.
In the same way that citizens' groups from around the world mobilized against the MA1 in 1998,
many such groups have declared themselves ready to resist the business community's frontal assault
on selective purchasing. Free Burma campaigners are vowing to "out" the corporations behind the
NFTC lawsuit and target them for boycott campaigns. They also point out that local governments
can easily carry out their "boycotts on steroids" with or without formal resolutions on the books.
The city of Vancouver is a case in point. In 1989, at the tail end of the apartheid boycott,
Vancouver passed a selective purchasing resolution that banned Shell gasoline from city-owned
vehicles because of the company's controversial dealings in South Africa. Similar resolutions were
passed — mostly relating to banks that issued loans to South Africa-by councils in Toronto, Ottawa
and Victoria. But Shell Canada decided to take the City of Vancouver to court for discrimination.
The case dragged on for nearly five years and in February 1994 the Supreme Court of Canada
ruled, by a margin of five to four, in Shell's favour. Judge John Sopinka wrote that the council had
indeed discriminated against Shell, and that councillors only had the jurisdiction to make

procurement decisions based on concerns for Vancouver residents — not for people in South
Africa. The purpose of the Shell boycott, he concluded, "is to affect matters beyond the boundaries
of the City without any identifiable benefit to its inhabitants."
Shell got what it wanted: the City of Vancouver's gas contract. But the company's problems were
far from over. When Shell again became the subject of international approbation after the hanging
of Ken Saro-Wiwa, local Sierra Club activists again began lobbying the Vancouver council to cut
its ties to Shell. In light of the Supreme Court ruling, the council could not formally pass another
selective purchasing resolution but, coincidentally, on July 8, 1997, it handed over a $6 million
contract to fuel the fleet of ambulances and police and fire vehicles for the entire Greater
Vancouver Regional District to Shell's competitor, Chevron. It is possible that the city's decision
was based solely on the merits of each company's bid, but there is little doubt that the human-rights
issue was also a factor. Included in the Greater Vancouver catchment area is the smaller
municipality of North Vancouver; less than four months before the contract went to Chevron, North
Vancouver councillors had voted unanimously to condemn Shell's behaviour in Ogoniland and to
direct its staff not to buy Shell gas. "We have to take a stand on corporations, against the way Shell
has raped the Ogoni people," one councillor said at the time. But since the North Vancouver
resolution was simply an expression of council's beliefs —with no mention of municipal contracts
— Shell could not appeal legally. When the contract went to Chevron, local environmentalists, who
had been keeping weekly vigils outside Shell gas stations in Vancouver for over a year, celebrated
it as a victory.
But was it a victory? Less than a year later, Bola Oyinbo, a thirty-three-year-old activist who led an
occupation of a Chevron oil barge in Nigeria's Ondo State, would be writing the following report:
Just as we were preparing to leave we saw three helicopters (choppers). They came like eagles,
swooping on chickens. We never expected what followed. As the choppers landed one after the
other discharging soldiers, what we heard were gunshots and fire. In fact they started shooting
commando style at us even before they landed. They shot everywhere. Arulika and Jolly fell. They
died instantly. Larry who was near him rushed to his aid, wanting to pick him up, he was also shot.
More soldiers came and more shooting followed. Some of my colleagues jumped over board into
the Atlantic, others ran into the platform. There was pandemonium. They shot teargas. White men
flew all the helicopters...We were defenceless, harmless.
The protest had begun peacefully on May 25, 1998, and it ended three days later in a bloodbath,
with two activists dead. The circumstances were eerily similar to those that had prompted Ken
Saro-Wiwa's campaign against Shell five years earlier. "Go to Awoye community and see what
they have done," Oyinbo writes. "Everything there is dead: mangroves, tropical forests, fish, the
freshwater, wildlife etc. All killed by Chevron.... our people complain of 'dead creeks.'" According
to Oyinbo, the community attempted on several occasions to negotiate with Chevron, but its
executives never showed up at the meetings. The occupation of the moored barge was a last resort,
they say, and the only demand was for a formal meeting with Chevron.
Oyinbo and his comrades accuse the company of hiring the soldiers who raided the barge, killing
two men and injuring as many as thirty others.

Chevron says it is not responsible for the actions taken by police officers on its rig — they were
simply enforcing the law against "pirates." Chevron spokesperson Mike Libbey denies that the
company paid the security officers to intervene, though he admits to alerting the authorities and
providing transportation to the platform. "We think it is unfortunate that people died, perhaps
unnecessarily, but that doesn't change the fact that in order for Chevron to do business in ninety
countries around the world, we must cooperate with governments of many kinds," he told reporters.
The company has further enraged the community by refusing to pay damages to the families of the
deceased — only burial costs. "If they want other compensations, they should write to us and the
company may decide to assist them on compassionate grounds," said Deji Haastrup, Chevron's
community relations manager. Perhaps fittingly, Chevron's CEO, Ken Derr, is one of the most
active members of l)SA*Engage and its crusade against sanctions and selective purchasing.
Unlike Shell, Chevron has not yet become the subject of an international brand boycott, though
there is a growing public awareness about the deaths that took place on May 28. Perhaps because
Bola Oyinbo lacks Ken Saro-Wiwa's international connections, the deaths of his two colleagues
were at first not even reported outside the Nigerian press. And it is sadly ironic that Chevron has
undoubtedly benefited from the fact that activists have made a strategic decision to focus their
criticism on Shell, rather than on the Nigerian oil industry as a whole. It points to one of the
significant, at times maddening, limitations of brand-based politics.

In this industry, the only reason to change is because someone has got a great cattle prod that
keeps jabbing you in the rear end.
-Bud Konheim, president of Nicole Miller Inc. clothing company, September 4, 1997

In One World, Ready or Not, William Greider writes that "focusing on the moral values of
particular companies —or their immorality — invites a self-righteous response among readers that
is too easy and undeserved.... Mike has concocted a particularly sick ideology to sell its shoes —
glamorous images of superstar athletes concealing the human brutalities —but why single out Mike
or Michael Jordan when the U.S. government itself is implicated in the same sickness?" Greider has

a valid point. The conduct of the individual multinationals is simply a by-product of a broader
global economic system that has steadily been removing almost all barriers and conditions to trade,
investment and outsourcing. If companies make deals with brutal dictators, sell off their factories
and pay wages too low to live on, it's because there is nothing in our international trading rules to
prevent them. But eliminating the inequalities at the heart of free-market globalization seems a
daunting task for most of us mortals. On the other hand, focusing on a Mike or a Shell and possibly
changing the behaviour of one multinational can open an important door into this complicated and
challenging political arena.
The all-star multinationals that have been the focus of this book are the celebrity face of global
capitalism, but when they come under close public scrutiny, the entire system is hauled under the
microscope as well. This is often a quite conscious strategy on the part of brand-based campaigns.
The Campaign for Labour Rights, for instance, openly admits that "when we debate Nike, we are
debating the new global economy.” Click on the Beyond McDonald's icon on the McSpotlight Web
site and you'll learn that "due to its massive public prominence and indisputable arrogance
[McDonald's] has simply been used as a symbol of all corporations pursuing their profits at any
price." And Stephen Coats, in explaining why he chose to make Starbucks the centre of a drive to
improve conditions in the Guatemalan coffee industry, said simply: "You have to start somewhere.
You start with one company.” Even the small-town battles against Wal-Mart take place at least
partly on this symbolic level. John Jarvis, a historical preservationist and one of Wal-Mart's most
vocal foes, explains that "the good thing about Wal-Mart was that it was big enough, nasty enough,
and aggressive enough to make the problem of uncontrolled growth clear."
But when one logo gets all the attention, even when it is being used tactically to illustrate broader
issues, others are unquestionably let off the hook. As we have seen, Chevron has been awarded
contracts that Shell lost, and Adidas has enjoyed a massive market comeback by imitating Nike's
labour and marketing strategies, while sidestepping all of the controversy. The most hypocritical of
all is Reebok, which has rushed to capitalize on Nike's controversies by positioning itself as the
ethical shoe alternative. "Consumers are looking for what a company stands for," Jo Harlow,
Reebok's vice president of marketing, says in relation to Nike's fall from grace. And to make sure
that consumers find what they are looking for in Reebok, the company has taken to handing out
high-profile Reebok Human Rights Awards to activists who fight against child labour and
repressive dictatorships. This is all rather sanctimonious, coming from a company that produces
many of its shoes in the very same factories as Nike, and that has seen more than its own share of
human-rights violations, though with less attendant publicity.
Gerard Greenfield, whose firsthand research into garment, shoe and toy factories in Asia has been
the backbone of dozens of international campaigns, admits that he has become tired of the double
standard. He points out that in March 1997, the international community was outraged by a report
that a group of women at a Nike factory called Pou Chen in Vietnam were beaten by a supervisor
and forced to run laps around the grounds. But, he writes, "less than a month later the same severe
punishment was imposed on workers at another Taiwanese-invested shoe factory, Giant V.... News
of this case was sent out to the groups campaigning on labour practices at Pou Chen. However,
despite the similarity in these cases, it was not taken up by human-rights and labour-rights
campaign groups in Europe, North America and Australia, simply because the factory does not
produce Nike shoes.... It seems that unless the Nike connection is made, such incidents are
irrelevant." And so a warped hierarchy of oppression is emerging from the factories of the Third

World: when it comes to seeking international solidarity, only designer injustices need apply. Bob
Ortega makes a similar point about the anti-Wal-Mart movement in his book In Sam We Trust.
There is a terrific irony —if one not much appreciated by Wal-Mart executives — in the fact that
hundreds of towns and suburbs across North America will fight mightily to keep the dreaded WalMart at bay, even as many of these communities let in scores of other superstore retailers that try
to ape Wal-Mart in every way they can.... To the extent that Wal-Mart's critics blast it for wiping
out Main Street businesses, for homogenizing communities, for trying to crush any and all rivals,
for selling goods made in sweatshops here and abroad, they are missing the forest for the biggest
tree.
But there is also a clear value in the big-tree approach. Ken Saro-Wiwa's brother Owens points out
that although all the gas companies have skeletons in their closets, focusing on one company —
Shell Oil in the case of Nigeria — can have concrete advantages. "It is important not to make
people feel powerless. After all, they need to fill their cars with something. If we tell them all
companies are guilty, they will feel they can do nothing. What we are trying to really do, now that
we have this evidence against this one company, is to let people have the feeling that they can at
least have the moral force to make one company change." He also says that since Shell controls
more than half of Nigeria's oil, whatever happens to Shell will serve as a lesson to all the other oil
companies, including Chevron.

uv^?_d{`ij+kz]7^/	-d?cXnx{jJ¬¬h_3d{gg$^/_aÂ¨d/<j+dk?jJ<}_3n
Wiwa is convinced that with continued pressure, Shell will eventually meet the campaign's
demands for economic and environmental reparations in Ogoniland. The millions Shell has poured
into public relations and restructuring already show how seriously even the most profitable
company in the world must take its public image. But much of that has to do with the visibility and
vulnerability of the Shell brand. Shell extracts a raw resource from the land and water in Nigeria,
but it brands that resource with its logo and sells it at its own branded gas stations around the world.
And it is at that point that consumers make a choice between Shell and Texaco or Shell and
Chevron — a choice that is as arbitrary and image based as the one between Coke and Pepsi,
McDonald's and Burger King. Oil is a raw resource, but it only really becomes accessible to most
people as a brand.
The same cannot be said of most multinationals in the natural-resource industries. Mining, natural
gas, seed and logging multinationals all trade in virtually unbranded commodities that they sell to
governments and corporate clients who then transform them into consumer goods. Since resource
companies don't sell directly to the public, they barely have to worry about their public image - a
factor that brings up what is perhaps the most significant limitation of brand-based campaigns: they
can be powerless in the face of corporations that opt out of the branding game.
So all over the world, children work in fields with toxic pesticides, in dangerous mines and in
rubber and steel factories where small fingers and hands are sliced off or mangled in heavy
machinery. Many of these children are producing goods for the export market: canned fish, tea,
rice, rubber for tires. But their plight has never captured the world's imagination like that of the kids

who make soccer balls with swooshes on them or clothing for Barbie dolls, because their
exploitation is unbranded, and therefore less identifiable, less visible, in our image-obsessed world.
The Free Burma movement has felt this limitation keenly. The campaign has been astonishingly
successful at shaming nearly every brand-name company out of the country, from Pepsi to Texaco.
When Heineken pulled out in July 1996, CEO Karel Vuursteen minced no words in explaining his
decision: "Public opinion and issues surrounding this market have changed to a degree that could
have an adverse effect on our brand and corporate reputation" — another casualty of the branding
boomerang. Relatively speaking, however, beer, soft-drink and clothing companies were never
major players on the Burmese scene. The largest foreign development — accounting for half of all
foreign investment — is a $1.2 billion gas line financed by Unocal, which is U.S. based, and Total,
which is French-owned. But "Unocal," as Human Rights Watch noted in its 1997 World Report,
"remained indifferent to protests." CEO Roger Beach defiantly told the press: "Let me say
unequivocally that the only way we will leave is if we are forced to by the enactment of law." And
why should Beach care what a bunch of university students and church groups have to say? In
1997, Unocal sold the last of its U.S. retail outlets and refiners. So we don't go and buy our bottles
of Unocal at Wal-Mart, or slap the Unocal logo on baseball hats and T-shirts. Activists have tried to
fight the gas company through the courts, but so far without luck. When brand image is the weapon,
an unbranded company can get off the hook entirely.

_w3Xdkhj
~y`b4~Ew3gg$n
There are, however, ways around this obstacle, as the Lubicon Cree discovered when the Japanese
pulp-and-paper giant Daishowa Marubeni-International unveiled plans for a major logging and mill
operation on land that the Cree claimed was rightfully theirs. The area in Northern Alberta has been
the subject of a fierce land-claim dispute in which the Canadian government has managed to avoid
negotiating a settlement for sixty-five years. In the meantime, logging and mining have caused
massive damage to the ecosystem and to the Lubicon way of life. So when Daishowa refused to
withdraw its $500 million logging operation until the land claim was settled, the Lubicon saw it as
the final straw. If neither the government nor the company would listen, they would have to go after
Daishowa directly. But how? Daishowa is hardly a household name — it cuts down trees and turns
them into paper goods that it then sells in bulk to other large corporations. How can you target a
company that has absolutely no interaction with the general public?
The Friends of the Lubicon, an activist support group, were struggling with that very question over
pizza one night in 1989 when one member of the group looked down at the Pizza Pizza paper bag
on the table and saw, printed in small lettering at the bottom, the Daishowa trademark. There it was.
The campaign strategy, the Lubicon soon decided, would be to call for a "secondary boycott": they
would ask Daishowa's clients —among them Pizza Pizza, the Canadian clothing retailer Roots and
Woolworths to sever their ties to Daishowa or face boycotts themselves. Though Daishowa has no
brand image itself, many of its clients do, and good customer relations are of central importance to
them. It wasn't long before many of them started getting their paper bags elsewhere. The strategy
proved so successful that in 1995, Daishowa took the Friends of the Lubicon to court, claiming the
boycott was unlawful and had cost the company $14 million in lost revenue." But on April 14,

1998, an Ontario court judge ruled in favour of the Friends of the Lubicon. After the ruling, the
Lubicon vowed to bring back the boycott with renewed force unless Daishowa agreed to stay off
the disputed land. Two weeks later, Daishowa pledged "not to harvest or purchase timber" in the
entire contested area until the land claim was resolved.
From the beginning of its clash with the Lubicon Cree, Daishowa insisted it was being unfairly
targeted, caught in the crossfire of a dispute between the band and government. In many ways, that
is true. The targeting of the multinational and its clients was an act of desperation. As Kevin
Thomas, spokesperson of the Friends of the Lubicon, says, "The government was never going to
settle so long as the Lubicon people were the only ones suffering — the only ones unable to carry
on with business as usual." By making sure that Daishowa was also unable to carry out its business,
the Lubicon drew one step closer to achieving a sustainable political solution. Greider is right:
individual corporations are only one piece of the puzzle. But as the Daishowa case shows, they can
be a piece of the puzzle that acts as a lever to achieve broader and more lasting political change.
The Daishowa precedent serves as a powerful warning to all the other faceless, resource-based
corporations that conduct their operations in relative obscurity. Investigative activists are starting
to track the progress of harvested natural resources through the economy to the point that they
turn into consumer goods; at that stage public pressure can be applied at the mall, superstore or
grocery chain. Nickel turns into batteries, genetically modified agricultural crops into packaged
foods, old-growth wood into furniture, gold into jewellery.... There is no harvested resource that
does not, eventually, turn into a brand.
This strategy has already proved enormously successful in the European campaign against
genetically modified foods. For years campaigners had been railing against agribusiness giant
Monsanto (that most impenetrable of multinationals) and its refusal to label which foods had been
modified and which had not — and, in the case of soybeans, actually mixing the two together. But
when campaigners broadened their focus to include not just companies like Monsanto and Novartis,
responsible for the genetic engineering, but also the supermarkets that sold their foods, the issue
finally grabbed the world's attention. With shoppers shouting about "Frankenfoods" on their
doorsteps and Greenpeace campaigners leading customers on "gene food tours" through their aisles,
the supermarkets could not afford to share Monsanto's cloistered attitude. Eventually, several large
British supermarket chains including Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway all removed bio-engineered
foods from their private-label brands. Marks & Spencer went further, banning from its stores, in
March 1999, all foods containing genetically modified ingredients. Chains across Western Europe
followed suit, as did food giants Unilever U.K., Nestle U.K. and Cadbury.
Environmentalists have taken a similar tack with the forestry companies logging old-growth trees in
British Columbia. Rather than continuing to face off against loggers in the deep woods —as was
the strategy during the Clayoquot Sound demonstrations of 1993 —Greenpeace and the Rainforest
Action Network now target high-profile brands that buy products derived from old-growth timber.
In response to this pressure, in December 1998, twenty Fortune 500 companies —including 3M,
Kinko's, Hallmark, IBM and Nike — agreed to phase out their use of old-growth products, and they
made their commitment public in a full-page ad in The New York Times. But Home Depot —"the
world's largest retailer of ancient forest products," according to the campaign — refused to sign on,
sparking a wave of protests at dozens of Home Depot outlets across North America, as well as at

the company's annual general meeting in Atlanta, in May 1999. The strategy proved successful: in
August 1999, Home Depot announced it would phase out old-growth wood products by 2002.

Despite the success of these strategies, it nonetheless seems odd that we need to go to such great
lengths to reshape social and environmental injustices just so that they can be brought home to us
shoppers. In a way, these campaigns help us to care about issues not because of their inherent
justice or importance but because we have the accessories to go with them: Nike shoes, Pepsi, a
sweater from the Gap. If we truly need the glittering presence of celebrity logos to build a sense of
shared humanity and collective responsibility for the planet, then maybe brand-based activism is the
ultimate achievement of branding. According to Gerard Greenfield, international political solidarity
is becoming so dependent on logos that these corporate symbols now threaten to overshadow the
actual injustices in question. Talk about government, talk about values, talk about rights — that's all
well and good, but talk about shopping and you really get our attention. "If we can only talk about
workers' collective rights and struggles in the context of what people choose to buy as consumers,"
writes Greenfield, "then it seems we face a greater challenge to building a critical, popular social
consciousness than we might imagine."
There is no doubt that Anticorporate activism walks a precarious line between self-satisfied
consumer rights and engaged political action. Campaigners can exploit the profile that brand names
bring to human-rights and environmental issues, but they have to be careful that their campaigns
don't degenerate into glorified ethical shopping guides: how-to's on saving the world through
boycotts and personal lifestyle choices. Are your sneakers "Mo Sweat"? Your rugs "Rugmark"?
Your soccer balls "Child Free"? Is your moisturizer "Cruelty-Free"? Your coffee "Fair Trade"?
Some of these initiatives have genuine merit, but the challenges of a global labour market are too
vast to be defined — or limited —by our interests as consumers.
It took almost no time, for instance, for the White House Task Force on Sweatshops, set up in
response to the Kathie Lee Gifford scandal, to become just another shopping exercise. Any
substantial demands for labour-law reform were immediately hijacked by a new agenda: what
provisions would U.S. companies have to meet before they could sew a "No Sweat" label on their
garments? The immediate priority was finding a quick and easy way to protect the right of
Westerners to buy branded goods without guilt. Tellingly, Bill Clinton's "No Sweat" labelling
initiative is modelled after the "Dolphin Safe" stamp on cans of tuna, which reassures buyers that
the much-loved dolphin was not killed in the canning of the fish. What this proposal fails to grasp is
that the rights of garment workers, unlike dolphins, cannot be assured by a symbol on a label, the
equivalent of a best-before date; and that trying to do so represents nothing less than the wholesale
privatization of their (and our) political rights. The whole charade reminds me of a New Yorker
cartoon that shows a Norman Rockwell-esque family unwrapping gifts under a Christmas tree. The
parents are pulling out a new pair of sneakers, as the mother asks: "How are the human rights on
these?"
There is another problem with the consumer-based approach. We are living, as Susan Sontag said,
in the "Age of Shopping" and any movement that is primarily rooted in making people feel guilty
about going to the mall is a backlash waiting to happen. Besides, the activists who are leading this
movement aren't austere Luddites who are against shopping on principle. Many of them are creative

twenty-something’s designing ad jams on their Mac laptops who happen to believe that there
should be some space left over that isn't trying to sell them something or cluttered with the debris of
our consumer culture. They are young men and women in Hong Kong and Jakarta who wear Nikes
and eat at McDonald's, and tell me they are too busy organizing factory workers to bother with
Western lifestyle politics. And while Westerners sweat over what kinds of shoes and shirts are most
ethical to buy, the people sweating in the factories line their dorm rooms with McDonald's
advertisements, paint "NBA Homeboy" murals on their doors and love anything with "Meeckey."
The organizers in the Cavite zone often dress for work in ersatz Disney or Tommy T-shirts —
cheap knockoffs from the local market. How do they reconcile the contradiction between their
clothes and their anger at these multinationals? They told me they had never really thought about it
like that; politics in Cavite is about fighting for concrete improvements in workers' lives — not
about what name happens to be on a T-shirt you happen to have on your back.
Corporate codes of conduct are in many ways the most controversial by-product of brand-based
activism. The moment multinational companies like Mike, Shell, Mattel and the Gap stopped
denying the existence of abuses at their sites of production and resource extraction, they began
drafting statements of principles, codes of ethics, memorandums of understanding and other nonlegally-binding documents of good intentions. These pieces of paper espoused high standards of
business ethics: non-discrimination, respect for the environment and for the rule of law. If any
busybody customer wanted to know how their products were made, the public-relations department
simply mailed them a copy of the code, as if it were the list of nutritional information on the side of
a box of Lean Cuisine.
When you read the codes, it's difficult not to get swept up in the starry-eyed idealism of it all. These
documents stare back at their readers with a look of perfect ahistorical innocence as if to ask, Why
are you surprised? We have been like this all along.... And the reader would be forgiven for
wondering, at least for a moment, if perhaps it is just as the companies say: one big
misunderstanding, a "communication breakdown" with a rogue contractor, something lost in the
translation.
Codes of conduct are awfully slippery. Unlike laws, they are not enforceable. And unlike union
contracts, they were not drafted in cooperation with factory managers in response to the demands
and needs of employees. Without exception, they were drafted by public-relations departments in
cities like New York and San Francisco in the immediate aftermath of an embarrassing media
investigation: Wal-Mart's code arrived after reports surfaced that its supplier factories in
Bangladesh were using child labour; Disney's code was born of the Haitian revelation; Levi's wrote
its policy as an answer to prison labour scandals. Their original purpose was not reform but to
"muzzle the offshore watchdog" groups, as Alan Rolnick, lawyer for the American Apparel
Manufacturers Association, advised his clients.
But the companies who rushed to adopt these codes made a serious miscalculation: they
underestimated, once again, the amount of information flowing between workers and villagers in
Africa, Central America and Asia and campaigns in Europe and North America — and so rather
than "muzzling" anyone, the documents have only raised more questions. Why did Shell fail to
translate its manifesto, Profits and Principles, into any language other than English and Dutch?
Why, until two years ago, were Nike and the Gap's codes available only in English? Why weren't
they distributed to workers in the factories? Why was there such a great discrepancy between the

intentions espoused in the codes and the firsthand reports coming out of the zones and the oil
fields? Who is supposed to monitor these codes through all the layers of contracting and
subcontracting? Who will enforce them? What is the penalty of failure?
In short, these hybrids of advertising copy and the Communist Manifesto backfired. The offshore
watchdogs kept on barking — and no wonder. Anti-corporate campaigns are fuelled, at least in part,
by people's deep sense of marketing overload — and for this reason, the last thing likely to mollify
them is more marketing. A group of anti-Shell campaigners made that point dramatically in March
1999 after Shell launched a $32 million marketing campaign that flawlessly absorbed the rhetoric
of both the Brent Spar and the Ogoni campaigns. "Exploit or Explore?" asks the glossy Shell ad.
Every business wants to make its mark. However, in the sensitive regions of the world, like our
tropical rainforests and our oceans, the scars of industrialisation are all too apparent. Our shared
climate and finite natural resources concern us as never before, and there's no room for an attitude
of "It's in the middle of nowhere, so who's to know?" Time and again at Shell, we're discovering
the rewards of respecting the environment when doing business. If we're exploring for oil and gas
reserves in sensitive areas of the world, we consult widely with the different local and global
interest groups. Working together, our aim is to ensure that bio-diversity in each location is
preserved. We also try to encourage these groups to monitor our progress so that we can review
and improve the ways in which we work.
But rather than stemming the flow of criticism, Shell's extravagant spending on public relations —
with the Ogoni's grievances left unresolved and demands for outside monitoring repeatedly rejected
— sparked its own kind of backlash: a backlash against "greenwash." Essential Action, the hub of
the Shell boycott, launched a postcard campaign urging Shell's executives to "Spend the money
cleaning up your mess, not your image!" And, in April 1999, activists in London threw green and
red paint on the doors of the company's international headquarters. The green paint, said the
anonymous perpetrators, was an attempt to give Shell "a taste of its own greenwash."
Throwing paint is one approach. Another, and one that has become increasingly popular, is
throwing the promises in the codes of conduct back in the face of the corporations who drafted
them. Once again, it's the Saul Alinsky theory of political jujitsu: "No organization ...can live up to
the letter of its own book. You can club them to death with their 'book' of rules and regulations."
Bama Athreya of the U.S.-based International Labour Rights Fund explains how this strategy can
work with relation to dike's high-minded code of conduct: "Let's face it, hypocrites are far more
interesting than mere wrongdoers, and it's been much easier to sensitize press and public to Mike's
failure to implement its own code of conduct than to its failure to comply with Indonesian labour
law."
As it became clear that these flimsy codes of conduct had failed to quiet dissent (and may have
exacerbated it), several multinationals moved on to a more advanced brand of corporate code.
These codes, while still not legally binding and still implemented on a voluntary basis with little
monitoring, are nonetheless more substantial than a simple statement of good intentions. And by
1998, there were so many different models of these codes floating around that even the most
committed anti-sweatshop campaigners had to admit that they had lost track. Some were drafted in
cooperation with human-rights groups or ethical investment specialists in the West. Others, like Bill
Clinton's Apparel Industry Partnership's code, were organized according to where the

multinationals were headquartered. The Gap has a code that applies to one factory in El Salvador,
allowing it to be monitored by local human-rights activists; a code adopted by Levi's, Mattel and
Reebok refers specifically to doing business in China. A code on child labour drafted by Unicef, the
International Labour Organization and an association of Pakistani manufacturers was signed by all
the major soccer-ball manufacturers; it provides for outside monitoring as well as education and
rehabilitation for the child labourers. Following the wave of anti-sweatshop student activism in
1998 and 1999, dozens of universities adopted their own codes, only to decide subsequently to sign
on to the Clinton Apparel Industry Partnership's code en masse —a totally different text.
Meanwhile, the Collegiate Licensing Company proposed its own anti-sweatshop code, to apply to
all 160 American schools it represents —meaning that some schools were looking at three tiers of
codes. And unlike the tough codes adopted by universities like Duke, the CLC code has no
provision for disclosure and does not require contractors to pay a living wage, only the minimum
wage.
Layered on top of these stacks of codes was one drafted by the Council on Economic Priorities, a
consumer watchdog group in New York, along with several large corporations. The CEP plan
would inspect factories for adherence to a set of standards covering key issues such as health,
safety, overtime, child labour and the like. Under this model, brand-name multinationals like Avon
and Toys 'R' Us, rather than trying to enforce their own codes around the world, simply place their
orders with factories that have been found to be in compliance with the code. Then, the factories are
monitored by a private auditing company, which certifies factories that meet the code as "SA8000"
(SA stands for "Social Accountability"). For many multinationals, this plan was far too demanding;
the American Apparel Manufacturers Association, for instance, launched its own, less stringent,
voluntary code, which would also certify factories "sweatshop free."
Not surprisingly, by mid-1999 the entire sweatshop issue had degenerated into a maze of warring
codes. Unions and religious groups who had been participating in the Clinton Apparel Industry
Partnership walked out in protest at its weak enforcement and monitoring measures, and accused
the human-rights groups that stayed in the Partnership of "selling out." The student anti-sweatshop
activists launched an offensive against their own universities' participation in the Clinton
Partnership, insisting that no code drafted or monitored by the corporations themselves - even at
arm's length — could possibly have any merit. Monitoring had to be done by unions or by humanrights groups.
Confusing matters still further was a strange conflation of several large human-rights groups and
the corporate sector. In 1999, some of the most maligned multinationals on the planet —Dow
Chemical, Nestle, Rio Tinto, Unocal - rushed into partnership with human-rights groups and the
United Nations Development Programme. Together they formed brand-new umbrella organizations
with names like the Business Humanitarian Forum, Partners in Development and the Global
Sustainable Development Facility, which promised to "improve communications and cooperation
between global corporations and humanitarian organizations." Multinationals and human-rights
groups, they claimed, actually have the same goals; human rights are good for business — they are
the "third bottom line."
It's tempting to take this dramatic shift in direction on the part of so many multinationals as a
massive victory for the campaigners who have battled the Mikes and the Shells all these years.
Maybe corporations really have seen the light, and we're all on the same page now.... Harvard

business professor Debora I. Spar is among those hailing the dawn of this new age. She argues that
the rise of brand-based activism has been so successful in shaming corporations, it is no longer in
the financial interest of brand-name multinationals to allow abuses to occur. She calls this theory
the "spotlight phenomenon." There is no need for outside regulations because "firms will cut off
abusive suppliers or make them clean up because it is now in their financial interest to do so," she
writes. "The spotlight does not change the morality of U.S. managers. It changes their bottom line."
There is no doubt that companies like Nike have learned that labour-rights abuses can cost them.
But the spotlight being shined on these companies is both roving and random: it is able to shine
down on a few corners of the global production line, but darkness still shrouds the rest. Human
rights, far from being protected by this process, are selectively respected: reforms seem to be
implemented solely on the basis of where the spotlight's beam was last directed. There is absolutely
no evidence that any of this reform activity is coalescing into a universal standard of ethical
corporate behaviour that will be applied around the world; and no system of universal enforcement
is on the horizon.
Instead, what we have with the proliferation of voluntary codes of conduct and ethical business
initiatives is a haphazard and piecemeal mess of crisis management. In mid-1999, for instance,
when Nike was coming off as a saviour in Indonesia for increasing wages, it was also cutting its
ties with higher-waged workers in the Philippines and rushing into China, where workers' rights are
least protected, monitoring is next to impossible and wages are lowest. Levi's pulled out of Burma,
because its conscience simply would not allow it to stay, only to go back to China, which it had
abandoned a few years earlier for the same reason. It then drafted a breakthrough code of conduct
for China, but at the same moment it was laying off thousands of workers in Europe and North
America. The Gap, meanwhile, was being held up as a model of openness and reform in El
Salvador, while protestors outside its stores in New York and San Francisco shouted about the
abhorrent conditions at its factories in Saipan and Russia. In addition, there were wildly diverging
reports about whether even the toughest codes were actually being implemented in the factories,
and whether the vast majority of workers around the world had even heard of them. And, of course,
there is still no monitoring system in place to get an accurate picture of what's really happening in
the factories. Without question, some imaginative and effective initiatives have come out of these
PR scrambles, but the fact remains that this patchwork approach is no way to draft a sustainable
labour or environmental policy for the global economy.
If the way multinationals like Nike and Shell have handled their respective scandals seems
uncharacteristically chaotic for such streamlined operators, that chaos could well be deliberate.
Even when the codes fail to stamp out abuses, what they do manage to do, rather effectively, is
obscure the fact that multinationals and citizens do not actually share the same goals when it comes
to deciding how to regulate against labour and environmental abuses. Even when there is genuine
agreement on the need to address a problem (child labour, for instance), beneath the talk of ethics
and partnerships the two parties are still engaged in a classic power struggle.
Ever since key multinationals stopped denying the existence of any human-rights abuses in their
global production operations, the struggle has not been over whether controls need to be put in
place, but rather over who will get to place those controls. Will it be the people and their
democratically elected representatives? Or will it be the global corporations themselves? It's clear

from the privatized codes which direction the corporations want to go. The question is, What will
citizens do in response?
The subtext of the codes of conduct is a settled hostility toward the idea that citizens can —through
unions, laws and international treaties — take control of their own labour conditions and of the
ecological impact of industrialization. In the twenties and thirties, when the crises of sweatshops,
child labour and workers' health were at the forefront of the political agenda in the West, these
problems were tackled with mass unionization, direct bargaining between workers and employers
and governments enacting tough new laws. That type of response could be marshalled again, only
this time on a global scale, through the enforcement of existing International Labour Organization
treaties, if compliance with those treaties were observed with the same commitment that the World
Trade Organization now shows in its enforcement of the rules of global trade.
The United Nations Declaration of Human Rights already recognizes the right to freedom of
association. If respecting that right became a condition of trade and investment, it would transform
the free-trade zones overnight. If workers in the zones had the freedom to bargain for their rights
without living in fear of either a government crackdown or immediate factory flight, the need for
private codes and independent monitors would virtually disappear. In countries like the Philippines
and Indonesia, governments would enforce these standards, and their own laws, or fear the
economic repercussions. But then, this type of rigid regulation is exactly what the corporate sector
has so aggressively fought since free trade was introduced — by yanking the teeth out of the UN's
declarations and treaties, and by steadfastly opposing all proposals to link trade deals to enforceable
labour and environmental codes. In fact, it is precisely this kind of regulation that multinationals are
now trying so frantically to circumvent by drafting their own voluntary codes.
And so, after Nike and dozens of universities had joined the White House Partnership, Charles
Kernaghan saw clearly that the anti-sweatshop movement he helped launch had become an entirely
new ball game. Gone were the days when the most pressing task was convincing companies that
they even had a problem. "Nike hopes to co-opt our movement," he writes. "In this view, what we
are seeing is no less than a struggle over who will control the agenda for eradicating sweatshop
abuses. Nike's implicit message is: 'Leave it to us. We have voluntary codes of conduct. We have a
task force. We'll take care of it from here. Go home and forget about sweatshops'."
There is something Orwellian about the idea of turning the enforcement of basic human rights into
a multinational industry, as the private codes would do, to be checked like any other quality control.
Global labour and environmental standards should be regulated by laws and governments - not by a
consortium of transnational corporations and their accountants, all following the advice of their PR
firms. The bottom line is that corporate codes of conduct —whether drafted by individual
companies or by groups of them, whether independently monitored mechanisms or useless pieces
of paper — are not democratically controlled laws. Not even the toughest self-imposed code can
put the multinationals in the position of submitting to collective outside authority. On the contrary,
it gives them unprecedented power of another sort: the power to draft their own privatized legal
systems, to investigate and police themselves, as quasi nation-states.
So this is a power struggle, make no mistake. In an editorial in The Journal of Commerce, codes of
conduct are explicitly presented to employers as a less threatening alternative to externally imposed
regulation. "The voluntary code helps diffuse a contentious issue in international trade negotiations:

whether to make labour standards part of trade agreements. If...the sweatshop problem is solved
outside the trade context, labour standards will no longer be tools in the hands of protectionists."
Such warnings hint that despite the ineffectiveness of governments and the rhetoric of corporate
triumphalism, there are still some mechanisms left with which to regulate multinationals. As we
have seen, there are trade agreements and local selective purchasing laws, as well as ethical
investment drives —but conditions can also be attached to government loans and insurance offered
to foreign investors, as well as to involvement in government trade missions. It may seem
unrealistic to suggest that multinationals would ever accept such restrictions on their global
mobility. Then again, the past four years have seen the world's most powerful and profitable brandname multinationals forced to continually raise the bar of their own public relations. If the public
will is there, the bar can be raised further still, taking these issues away from corporate control and
forcing them into the public domain.

The beers at my hotel bar in Rosario were blissfully cold, and the gang from the Workers'
Assistance Centre were all getting a little drunk. We were arguing, once again, about whether codes
of conduct have any merit whatsoever. Zernan Toledo (who personally favours armed revolution —
it's just a question of when) pounded the table. "These documents are written by the transnational
corporations, so they will only serve the transnational corporations — haven't you read Marx?"
"It's different now," I countered. "With globalization, there need to be some common standards —
and the governments certainly aren't setting them."
"Globalization is nothing new. We have always had globalization," said Arnel Salvador, another of
the WAC organizers. His eyes were fixed not on me, but on something across the bar. Since the
hotel where I stayed is the only one near the Cavite Export Processing Zone, it was, as usual,
packed with visiting factory owners, contractors and buyers who were here to stay up all night
singing karaoke and cutting deals for cheap clothes and electronics. I followed Arnel's eyes to a
young man slouched in his chair, his feet up on the table across from him, his knees splayed apart

as if he owned the world. Trendy and modern, he looked like a character from one of the many cellphone commercials on Asian TV. "You can always tell the foreigners," Arnel said slowly, his
usually warm voice icy. "No Filipino would sit like that."
The foreign investors who sing karaoke at the Mountain and Sea Hotel in Rosario are part of a long
and bitter history of colonialists in the Philippines: first the Spaniards came and conquered, then the
Americans arrived, setting up army bases and turning teenage prostitution into one of the country's
largest industries. Now colonialism is dead, the U.S. military has receded and the new imperialists
are the Taiwanese and Korean contractors in the export processing zones, sexually harassing the
eighteen-year-old Filipinas on the assembly lines. Several of the free-trade zones in the Philippines
(though not Cavite) are actually built on land that only a few years back housed U.S. military bases,
and all over the country workers are shuttled to and from the zones in U.S. army jeeps converted
into mini-buses. To Arnel Salvador and Zernan Toledo, the much-vaunted joys of economic
globalization amount to pretty much more of the same: the boss has just traded in his military
uniform for an Italian suit and an Ericsson cell phone.
The day after our night of drinking, I sat with Nida Barcenas in the backyard of the Workers'
Assistance Centre and asked her what motivates her, night after night, to trudge out to the dorms at
11 p.m. to meet with garment workers when they finally get off work. My question took Mida by
surprise. "Because I want to help the workers. I really want to help them," she said. Then the tough
composure that helps her stand up to zone bosses and petty local bureaucrats disappeared and fat
tears rolled down her smooth cheeks. All she managed to say was "It's like Arnel said — it's just
been so long." What has been so long is not the fight for rights for her fellow factory workers,
although she means that as well. What has been so long is the fight against feudal landlords, against
military dictators and now against foreign factory owners. I turned the tape recorder off and we sat
in silence until her colleague, Cecille Tuico, quietly brought us mugs of syrupy-sweet vanilla ice
cream that turned to soup in the hot sun.
Because the Workers' Assistance Centre’s chief mission is to empower workers to stand up for their
rights, WAC organizers don't much like the idea of Westerners swooping into the zone brandishing
codes of conduct, with teams of well-meaning monitors trailing behind. "The more significant way
to resolve those problems," says Nida Barcenas, "lies with the workers themselves, inside the
factory." And codes of conduct, she says, have little hope of helping because the workers have no
hand in drafting them. As for third-party independent monitoring, Zernan Toledo believes that no
matter who performs it, it's just that: third party. All it will do is reinforce the idea that somebody
else is looking after the workers' destiny, not the workers themselves. To some this flat-out
rejection sounds stubborn and ungrateful, an unfair dismissal of all the well-meaning work being
conducted in boardrooms in Washington, London and Toronto. But the right to sit down and
bargain - even when you don't get the perfect deal - is the fundamental right for which the
international trade union movement has struggled from its inception; it has always been about selfdetermination. Zernan Toledo invokes an old and familiar aphorism to explain the distinction: "If
you give a man a fish, he will eat for one day. But if you teach him how to fish he will eat forever."
And so, every evening at the Workers' Assistance Centre, Zernan, Arnel, Cecille and Nida give the
workers their fishing lessons. A little blackboard stands in the backyard with the chickens, and the
organizers take turns leading seminars. Sometimes fifty workers show up, other times just one.
Though this route will no doubt take longer than the ready-made codes and monitoring, the WAC

organizers say they are willing to wait. As Nida says, it has already "been so long," they may as
well get it right.
It's a message that applies not just in Cavite, but to all those concerned about corporate abuses
around the world. When we start looking to corporations to draft our collective labour and human
rights codes for us, we have already lost the most basic principle of citizenship: that people should
govern themselves. As we have seen, Nike, Shell, Wal-Mart, Microsoft and McDonald's have
become metaphors for a global economic system gone awry, largely because, unlike the back-door
wheeling and dealing at NAFTA, GATT, APEC, WTO, MA1, the EU, the 1ME, the G-8 and the
OECD, the methods and objectives of these companies are plain to see: workers and foreign
observers alike understand very well what they are up to. They have become the planet's best and
biggest popular education tools, providing some much-needed clarity inside the global market's
maze of acronyms and centralized, secretive dealings.
By attempting to enclose our shared culture in sanitized and controlled brand cocoons, these
corporations have themselves created the surge of opposition described in this book. By thirstily
absorbing social critiques and political movements as sources of brand "meaning," they have
radicalized that opposition still further. By abandoning their traditional role as direct, secure
employers to pursue their branding dreams, they have lost the loyalty that once protected them from
citizen rage. And by pounding the message of self-sufficiency into a generation of workers, they
have inadvertently empowered their critics to express that rage without fear.
But the fact that the brands have led us into this maze does not mean we should look to them to lead
us out. Nike and Shell are shiny new doorways opening onto the much more complicated and less
glamorous world of international law. And though it won't be easy and it won't come quickly, we
will find our way out as citizens, on our own. We may feel a little like Theseus, clutching his thread
as he entered the Minotaur's labyrinth, but nothing else will do. Political solutions — accountable
to people and enforceable by their elected representatives — deserve another shot before we throw
in the towel and settle for corporate codes, independent monitors and the privatization of our
collective rights as citizens.
It is a daunting task but it does have an upside. The claustrophobic sense of despair that has so often
accompanied the colonization of public space and the loss of secure work begins to lift when one
starts to think about the possibilities for a truly globally minded society, one that would include not
just economics and capital, but global citizens, global rights and global responsibilities as well. It
has taken many of us a while to find our footing in this new international arena, but thanks in large
part to the crash course provided by the brands, we are closer than ever before.
The first step has been an astonishingly successful network of popular-education projects. In 1995,
the International Forum on Globalization held its first Global Teach-in in New York, which brought
together leading scientists, activists and researchers to examine the impacts of a single, unfettered
world market on democracy, human rights, labour and the natural environment. There were
seminars on NAFTA, APEC, the IMF, the World Bank, Structural Adjustment of the North and
every other global body or trade agreement you never understood but were afraid to ask. The New
York Conference attracted several hundred people, but at the second conference in Berkeley,
California, two thousand people showed up (with zero pre-publicity and no media coverage —just

some posters and E-mail lists). A conference a few months later in Toronto attracted even more
people and there have been similar gatherings on university campuses around the world.
And world leaders can't have lunch together these days without somebody organizing a countersummit - gatherings that bring together everyone from sweatshop workers trying to unionize the
zones to teachers fighting the corporate takeover of education. At these events —in Geneva,
Cologne and Birmingham - alternative models of globalization spill onto the streets during the day,
and the Reclaim the Streets parties go on all night.
It is sometimes difficult to tell whether these trends are the start of something genuinely new or the
last gasps of something very old. Are they, as the engineering professor and peace activist Ursula
Franklin asked me, simply "wind blocks," creating temporary shelter from the corporate storm, or
are they the foundation stones of some as yet unimagined, free-standing edifice? When I started this
book, I honestly didn't know whether I was covering marginal atomized scenes of resistance or the
birth of a potentially broad-based movement. But as time went on, what I clearly saw was a
movement forming before my eyes.
Three years ago, when I attended the Berkeley teach-in on globalization, I was frustrated that the
speakers were all over fifty and that the links with the college-age culture jammers and
Anticorporate campaigners had yet to be made. A year later, these generations of activists and
theorists were already enmeshed on several fronts, lending urgency and depth of analysis to each
other's actions. During this same time, campaigns focusing on a single corporation in a single place
— Shell in Nigeria, say, or Nike in Indonesia — had also found each other and were starting a
process of intellectual cross-pollination, often at the click of a hotlink, thanks to the Net.
This emerging movement even has a major victory under its belt: getting the Multilateral
Agreement on Investment taken off the agenda of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development in April 1998. As the Financial Times noted with some bewilderment at the time,
"The opponents' decisive weapon is the Internet. Operating from around the world via web sites,
they have condemned the proposed agreement as a secret conspiracy to ensure global domination
by multinational companies, and mobilized an international movement of grassroots resistance."
The article went on to quote a World Trade Organization official who said, "The NGOs have tasted
blood. They'll be back for more."' Indeed they will.
On June 18, 1999, these virtual connections were made real when a coalition of groups including
Reclaim the Streets and People's Global Action held the second Global Street Party, this time to
coincide with the G-8 meeting in Cologne, Germany. The event, billed as a "global carnival against
capital," took aim squarely at corporate power. All around the world, parties and protests were held
in financial districts, outside stock exchanges, superstores, banks and multinational headquarters.
With simultaneous action in seventy different cities, the day was the coming-out party for this new
global political player: it displayed all of the movement's promise and creativity —and showed
more forcefully than ever before just how much Anticorporate rage is brewing.
Though they were organized locally, a common theme ran through all the events. In Bangladesh,
women garment workers held a protest against sweatshop conditions; in San Francisco, they
protested those same conditions outside Gap stores. In Montevideo, Uruguay, activists turned the
main square of the city's financial district into a "fair trade" show, with exhibits on every corporate

abuse from child labour to the arms trade; in Madrid, the entrance to the stock exchange was
blocked. And in Cologne, site of the G-8 summit, European activists held a counter-summit and
demanded debt forgiveness for Third World countries. The event was joined by five hundred Indian
farmers who were travelling across Western Europe in an "intercontinental caravan." Along the
way, they stopped off at the corporate headquarters of agribusinesses such as Cargill and Monsanto
whose seed patents and genetic engineering of crops have burdened many Indian farmers with
massive debts.
On the same day that the Indian farmers were peacefully protesting in Cologne, London's financial
district turned into a war zone —the city hasn't seen anything like it since the 1990 poll-tax riots.
The 10,000-strong gathering started as a classic RTS surreal political party. The streets were
cleared by a Critical Mass bike ride and were flooded by activists dressed in second-hand suits with
slogans painted on the backs. They danced in the doorsteps of office towers, formed a human chain
around the Treasury and held peaceful sit-ins at several banks. The bankers and investment brokers,
meanwhile, came to work disguised in casual sports clothes, having been advised by police to
"blend in" with the activists so as not to catch a flying pie. But as the day wore on, the crowd
splintered into smaller groups and became gradually more violent. One group stormed the Futures
Exchange, breaking all the glass in the lobby, disrupting automated stock trading and forcing an
evacuation of the building. In other parts of London, a McDonald's outlet, a bank and a Mercedes
Benz dealership were trashed, a protestor was run over by a police van and several police were
injured. There was also mob violence in Eugene, Oregon: windows were broken at banks and fastfood restaurants, cars were stormed, protestors attacked cops with rocks and cops attacked
protestors with pepper spray. In both cities, the political messages about widening economic
disparities and the brutalities of free-market globalization were drowned out by the sound of
shattering glass.
In Geneva, the message was clear as day: rather than throwing rocks through windows, activists
arrived with sponges, soap and squeegees to wash the facades of the big downtown banks. The
organizers explained to the press that they only wanted to help these fine institutions clean up the
stains left behind by crippling Third World debt and Nazi gold. In Port Harcourt, Nigeria, the mood
at the "Carnival of the Oppressed" was militant but celebratory. A crowd of 10,000 welcomed Ken
Saro-Wiwa's brother back to his homeland after years in exile. After listening to a speech by Owens
Wiwa, the crowd proceeded to the gates of the city's Shell Oil headquarters and blocked entry for
several hours. The next stop was a street named after the late Nigerian dictator, General Sani
Abacha, where members of the crowd lowered the street sign and temporarily renamed the road
after one of the men whose lives he stole: Ken Saro-Wiwa. According to the organizers, "There was
dancing and singing in the streets, bringing Port Harcourt, Nigeria's petroleum capital, to a
standstill."
And all of this happened on a single day.
When this resistance began taking shape in the mid-nineties, it seemed to be a collection of
protectionists getting together out of necessity to fight everything and anything global. But as
connections have formed across national lines, a different agenda has taken hold, one that embraces
global-ization but seeks to wrest it from the grasp of the multinationals. Ethical shareholders,
culture jammers, street reclaimers, McUnion organizers, human-rights hacktivists, school-logo
fighters and Internet corporate watchdogs are at the early stages of demanding a citizen-centred

alternative to the international rule of the brands. That demand, still sometimes in some areas of the
world whispered for fear of a jinx, is to build a resistance — both high-tech and grassroots, both
focused and fragmented — that is as global, and as capable of coordinated action, as the
multinational corporations it seeks to subvert.
